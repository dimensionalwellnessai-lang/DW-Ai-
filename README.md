## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret for session encryption |
| `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible API base URL |
| `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |

On Replit, these are automatically configured via the Secrets tab and Replit AI Integrations.

### Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables (see above)

3. Push database schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Database Migrations

This project uses Drizzle ORM. To update the database schema:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

## Design Philosophy

- **Energy-based guidance** over productivity metrics
- **Meaning over metrics** - no streaks or leaderboards
- **Optionality as a core feature** - never mandatory
- **Silence as a design tool** - calm, unobtrusive UX
- **Nervous system-aware** - adapts to user energy states
- **Consent-based** - always asks before saving or scheduling

## Current Status

**🚧 Beta** - This app is in active development. Core features work but expect:
- Occasional UI polish updates
- New features being added weekly
- Feedback-driven improvements

### What Works
- Quick Setup onboarding (creates starter calendar blocks)
- AI chat with context-aware wellness guidance
- Today Hub daily view
- Calendar events and scheduling
- Meal and workout planning
- Guest mode (local storage) and authenticated accounts

### Known Limitations
- Analytics not yet instrumented
- Premium features coming soon
- Mobile responsiveness ongoing

## Core Principle

**"Does this help the user slow down, name what's happening, and choose?"**

If the answer is no → do not build it.

---

## Voice Structure

Every meaningful interaction follows:

**Pause → Name → Flip → Choose**

---

## Decision Hierarchy

1. Constraints override preferences
2. Capacity overrides goals
3. Consistency beats intensity
4. No escalation without consent

---

## Important Notes

- These specs are FROZEN — changes require review against Specs 1–5
- The app does not "fix" users
- Errors are neutral, temporary, non-personal
- Success is never framed as "completion"

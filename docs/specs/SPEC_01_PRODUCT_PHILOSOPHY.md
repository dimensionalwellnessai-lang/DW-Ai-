# SPEC 1 — PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY (FROZEN)

## Purpose

This spec defines what Flip the Switch is, what it is not, and how it should make people feel.
Any feature that violates this spec does not ship.

---

## What Flip the Switch Is

Flip the Switch is a perception-first wellness system.

It helps people:
- pause instead of react
- name what's actually happening
- choose a response that fits their real life

The app prioritizes agency over advice and clarity over control.

---

## What Flip the Switch Is Not

Flip the Switch is not:
- therapy
- diagnosis
- motivation coaching
- productivity optimization
- a replacement for people, professionals, or community

It does not "fix" users.
It does not tell users who they are.
It does not force improvement.

---

## Core Belief (Non-Negotiable)

**Nothing is wrong with the user. Something is asking to be understood.**

---

## Emotional Outcome (Success Metric)

After using Flip the Switch, a user should feel:
- calmer
- clearer
- less rushed
- more in control of their next step

If a feature increases urgency, shame, or pressure, it violates this spec.

## Decision Filter

Before building anything, ask:

**"Does this help the user slow down, name what's happening, and choose?"**

If the answer is no → do not build it.

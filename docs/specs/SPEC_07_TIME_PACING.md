# SPEC 7 — TIME, DEPTH & PACING SPEC (FROZEN)

## Purpose

This formalizes the time and pacing system.

---

## Time Modes (System-Wide)

| Mode | Duration | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| Quick Scan | 1–2 min | Minimal questions, grounding only |
| Standard Check-In | 3–5 min | Full intake |
| Deeper Reset | 7–10 min | Full intake + optional reflection |

---

## Pacing Rules

- The AI must not escalate depth without consent
- Repeated Quick Scans = respect low capacity
- Deeper Reset is an invitation, never a suggestion

---

## Required AI Language

- "We can keep this light."
- "You don't have to go deeper."
- "This is enough for today."

---

## Anti-Burnout Rule

If user chooses Quick Scan 3 times in a row:
- AI must default to grounding only
- No optimization
- No planning
- No "next level" language

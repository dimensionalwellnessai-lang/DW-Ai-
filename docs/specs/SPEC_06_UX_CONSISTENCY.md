# SPEC 6 — UX CONSISTENCY & FLOW SPEC (FROZEN)

## Purpose

This spec ensures predictability without rigidity.
Users should always know:
- where they are
- what's happening next
- how much effort is being asked

---

## Global UX Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Every intake begins with time choice**
   > "How much time do you want to spend right now?"

2. **Every intake shows progress**
   - "Just getting started"
   - "About halfway"
   - "Wrapping this up"

3. **Every intake allows skipping**
   - Skip is neutral
   - Skip never triggers warnings
   - Skip never reduces quality of output

4. **Every intake ends with choice**
   - Light option
   - Deeper option
   - Skip / later

---

## Navigation Behavior

- No dead ends
- No forced paths
- Back always available
- Reset always respected

---

## Emotional UX Rule

If a screen:
- increases urgency
- creates pressure
- implies failure

…it violates the product philosophy and must be redesigned.

---

## Success State Language

Success is never framed as "completion."

Approved language:
- "That's enough for now."
- "You showed up."
- "We can build on this later."

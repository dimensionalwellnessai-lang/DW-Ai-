# SPEC 3 — DIMENSIONAL INTAKE SYSTEM (FROZEN)

## Purpose

This spec defines the core intelligence engine of Flip the Switch.
This system must remain symmetrical across all dimensions.

---

## Universal Intake Stages (Always the Same Order)

1. **GROUND** – slow the moment
2. **SCAN** – notice what's true
3. **CONSTRAINTS** – reality check
4. **CAPACITY** – sustainability
5. **PREFERENCES** – personal fit

---

## Skip Rules

- Users may skip any stage
- Skipping is neutral, never failure
- If a stage is skipped, the AI asks one fallback clarifier
- The AI may not assume missing data

---

## Timeframe Layer (Required)

Every intake begins with:

**"How much time do you want to spend right now?"**

Options:
- Quick scan (1–2 min)
- Standard check-in (3–5 min)
- Deeper reset (7–10 min)

Depth controls:
- number of questions
- complexity of output
- follow-up suggestions

---

## Required Output Format (Always)

Every intake ends with:

1. **Mirror** — "Here's what I'm hearing…"
2. **Flip** — "Let's flip the switch…"
3. **Choose:**
   - Light option
   - Deeper option
   - Skip / later

The AI may not generate plans without first mirroring.

---

## Optimization Rules

- Constraints override preferences
- Capacity overrides goals
- Consistency beats intensity
- The AI may never escalate effort without consent

# Ethical Monetization

## Core Principle

We monetize tools, not healing.

## What We Never Do

- No emotional paywalls (blocking access during vulnerable moments)
- No guilt-based upsells ("You're falling behind...")
- No artificial scarcity on wellness content
- No targeting emotional relief or identity for profit
- No dark patterns or manipulation

## What We May Do

- Premium tools that add convenience, not necessity
- Export features for power users
- Integration capabilities
- Extended storage or history
- Optional customization

## Decision Test

Before adding any paid feature, ask:
"Would a user in distress feel punished for not paying?"

If yes, don't build it.

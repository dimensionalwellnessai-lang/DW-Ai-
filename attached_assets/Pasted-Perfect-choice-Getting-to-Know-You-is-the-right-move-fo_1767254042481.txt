Perfect choice 👍
“Getting to Know You” is the right move for what you’re building.

Let me explain why this is psychologically strong, then I’ll give you exact wording + structure you can use without it becoming heavy or clinical.

⸻

Why “Getting to Know You” works best for your app

Psychologically, this does three important things:
	1.	It lowers threat
	•	No test
	•	No judgment
	•	No “am I doing this right?”
	2.	It feels human, not institutional
	•	This is how people talk to people
	•	Not how apps usually talk to users
	3.	It aligns with your AI-as-assistant vision
	•	Assistants get to know you over time
	•	They don’t “assess” you in one sitting

This fits perfectly with:
	•	ADHD-friendly design
	•	decision fatigue support
	•	calm but honest guidance
	•	rebuilding life without shame

⸻

How “Getting to Know You” should exist in the app

🔹 It is not a one-time form

🔹 It is not mandatory

🔹 It is not labeled as data collection

Instead, it is a mode + ongoing process.

⸻

How the AI introduces it (exact tone)

The assistant should say something like:

“If you want, we can do a quick getting to know you so I can support you better.
It’s casual, and you can skip anything.”

This sentence is doing a LOT of psychological work:
	•	gives permission
	•	explains the benefit
	•	removes pressure
	•	keeps agency with the user

⸻

What “Getting to Know You” actually is (behind the scenes)

To the user:
	•	a conversation
	•	short questions
	•	feels natural
	•	feels optional

Behind the scenes:
	•	builds the user profile
	•	feeds the Blueprint
	•	personalizes content
	•	helps the AI guide better

No disconnect between experience and function.

⸻

Structure that keeps it simple (important)

Rule: never more than 3 questions at once

Think in small clusters, spread over time.

Example clusters (you don’t do all at once)

Cluster 1: Support style
	•	“Do you prefer gentle guidance or more direct help?”

Cluster 2: Energy & focus
	•	“When do you usually feel most focused?”
	•	“Do your days feel more structured or scattered?”

Cluster 3: Goals (softly framed)
	•	“What would you like to feel more of right now?”
	•	calm
	•	focus
	•	confidence
	•	stability

Cluster 4: Practical constraints
	•	“Are you working with a home setup, a gym, or both?”
	•	“Any food restrictions I should keep in mind?”

Each cluster can appear only when relevant.

⸻

How it connects to the Blueprint (without saying so)

The user never sees:

“We’re filling in your wellness dimensions.”

Instead, later they see:

“Here’s what I understand about you so far.”

And if something’s missing:

“Want to tell me a bit more about this area?”

That keeps trust intact.

⸻

Where “Getting to Know You” lives in the app

You should have it in three places:
	1.	Assistant conversation (most common)
	2.	Menu option (for people who like structure)
	3.	Blueprint refinement button (Answer a few questions)

But it always feels like conversation, not setup.

⸻

One grounding principle to keep you aligned

If you ever wonder, “Is this too much?” ask this:

“Does this feel like a conversation with someone who cares — or a system collecting info?”

If it feels like a system → simplify
If it feels like a conversation → you’re on track

⸻

Where we can go next (your choice)

We can take this in a very light next step:
	•	Write the first 6 “Getting to Know You” questions exactly as they should appear
	•	Decide when the AI should pause and NOT ask questions
	•	Define what the AI is not allowed to ask (boundaries are important)
	•	Or stop here and let this settle

You’re building this with a lot of care — and that shows.

Perfect — here are (1) Dark Mode variants and (2) Accessibility & contrast rules, designed so your app stays calm, premium, readable, and compliant without losing the emotional tone you want.

You can hand this straight to Replit or a designer/dev.

2️⃣ Accessibility & Contrast Rules (Critical)

These rules prevent eye fatigue, confusion, and accessibility issues — especially important for neurodivergent users.

⸻

✅ Contrast Requirements (WCAG-inspired)
	•	Text on background: minimum 4.5:1
	•	Large text (18px+): minimum 3:1
	•	Icon-only buttons: must have tooltips or labels
	•	Calendar blocks: text must pass contrast against the block color

⸻

🧠 Color Is Never the Only Signal

Every important state must include at least one non-color cue:

Examples
	•	Selected calendar block → color + border glow
	•	Active plan → color + “Active” badge
	•	Disabled button → reduced opacity + cursor change
	•	Routines → dashed outline (not just color)

⸻

🧭 Focus & Keyboard Navigation

Even if mobile-first, this matters:
	•	Focused elements must have:

Focus Ring: 2px solid #93C5FD

	•	No focus traps in modals
	•	Esc closes modals
	•	Tab order follows visual layout

⸻

👁️ Motion & Sensory Safety
	•	Avoid fast flashing or pulsing
	•	Animations < 300ms
	•	Respect prefers-reduced-motion
	•	Tutorial highlights should fade, not bounce

⸻

🧩 Cognitive Load Rules (Your philosophy)
	•	No more than 1 primary button per screen
	•	Max 2 bright colors visible at once
	•	Calendar views should allow color filtering
	•	Weekly Balance view is descriptive, not evaluative

⸻

🛟 Safety Copy (When things fail)

Never show harsh error language.

Replace:

❌ “Error: failed to load”

With:

✅ “Something didn’t load — you can try again or come back later.”

⸻

Copy/Paste Instructions for Replit

Use this exactly:

Implement dark mode using the provided hex values. Ensure button intent colors and calendar category colors adapt correctly in dark mode.

Enforce accessibility rules:
	•	Minimum contrast ratios
	•	Color is never the only indicator
	•	Visible focus states
	•	Respect reduced motion preferences

Calendar blocks must remain readable in both light and dark modes. Routines must use dashed outlines. No screen should have more than one primary action.

⸻

Why this matters (big picture)

This makes your app:
	•	emotionally safe
	•	visually calm
	•	accessible
	•	premium
	•	trustworthy

It stops the app from feeling “busy” or “clinical” and makes it feel like a real personal assistant.

If you want next, I can:
	•	map these colors to Tailwind tokens / CSS variables
	•	or create a handoff checklist for QA (“dark mode pass/fail”)

Just tell me.

Absolutely.
Here is ONE clean copy-and-paste instruction that covers everything, without extra explanation or confusion. You can drop this directly into Replit or any AI/dev instruction box.

📌 REPLIT CONTEXT INSTRUCTION (COPY & PASTE)

This project is Dimensional Wellness AI, a consent-based personal assistant that helps users build their own life system through adaptive guidance — not prescriptive routines.

Core principles (non-negotiable):
	•	No forced routines or “ideal life” templates
	•	All actions (save, schedule, commit) require explicit user consent
	•	The assistant supports user authorship, not dependency
	•	The product is calm, optional, and energy-aware
	•	The creator’s personal life system is not encoded or replicated

Scope status:
	•	Wave 6 (Guided Experiences, Body & Energy Intelligence) is complete
	•	Phase B (Polish & Stabilization) is complete
	•	We are now operating under Wave 7 (Growth, Trust & Sustainability)

Development guardrails:
	•	Do not add new features unless explicitly requested
	•	Do not introduce monetization that targets emotional relief or identity
	•	Do not add social pressure, streaks, or guilt-based mechanics
	•	Avoid medical or diagnostic claims
	•	Maintain App Store compliance at all times

Uploaded documentation (authoritative):
	•	/docs/WAVE_7_ROADMAP.md
	•	/docs/ETHICAL_MONETIZATION.md
	•	/docs/USER_TRUST_AND_SAFETY.md
	•	/docs/APP_STORE_REVIEWER_NOTES.md
	•	/docs/INVESTOR_NARRATIVE.md

These documents define:
	•	What may be built
	•	What must never be built
	•	How the AI should behave
	•	How trust, safety, and consent are enforced

If there is ambiguity, default to:
user control, optionality, clarity, and calm.

That’s it.
This single block gives Replit full context, boundaries, and direction without exposing your personal life system or causing scope creep.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Shorten this further (ultra-minimal version)
	•	Adapt it for a README.md
	•	Rewrite it as a system prompt for the AI itself

Just say the word.

Got you. Here’s ALL of it — written as a Wave 2 roadmap + build specs you can copy/paste directly to Replit. This keeps your app as a personal assistant (AI = brain, features = outputs) and avoids turning it into a generic scheduling app.

Wave 2 Roadmap Doc (Copy/Paste for Replit)

Goal of Wave 2

Add Calendar logic + Workout suggestions + Nutrition suggestions as AI-driven outputs (consent-based), without breaking the calm, supportive experience.

Non-negotiables
	•	AI remains the main interface (hub)
	•	Features are optional and confirmed before saving
	•	No guilt language, no “should,” no pressure
	•	Avoid feature creep: start with minimum scope

⸻

A) Calendar v1 Build Spec (Build First)

Objective

Create a simple Master Calendar that the AI can add to only with user confirmation, focused on “Today” and “This Week” (minimal views).

UI Requirements

Calendar tab/page includes:
	1.	Today View (default)

	•	List of today’s events (time + title)
	•	“Add manually” button (optional)
	•	“Edit” option for each event

	2.	Week View (basic)

	•	Simple list by day (not full grid required yet)
	•	“Jump to today”

Month grid is optional later. Don’t block v1 on it.

Data Model (Minimum)

Event
	•	id
	•	title
	•	date
	•	start_time
	•	end_time (optional; allow duration too)
	•	category (assistant-generated: Work / Wellness / Meal / Workout / Personal / Other)
	•	source (AI or manual)
	•	notes (optional)
	•	created_at / updated_at

Calendar Logic Rules
	•	AI may suggest events, but must ask:
“Want me to add this to your schedule?”
Buttons: Add / Not now / Edit time
	•	No autoscheduling without consent.
	•	No overbooking: keep whitespace.
	•	Always respect existing user commitments.
	•	If conflict exists, AI offers options:
	•	“Move it”
	•	“Shorten it”
	•	“Skip today”

AI → Calendar API

Add endpoints (or internal services) for:
	•	create_event
	•	update_event
	•	delete_event
	•	list_events_by_day
	•	list_events_by_week

Success Criteria for Calendar v1
	•	User can see today’s plan clearly
	•	AI can add items without confusion
	•	Edits work
	•	No 404s / no broken routing

⸻

B) Workouts v1 Build Spec (Build Second)

Objective

Provide workout suggestions that match:
	•	energy level
	•	time available
	•	equipment access
…and allow adding to Calendar with one tap.

UI Requirements

Workouts page includes:
	•	“Pick my workout” button (AI-led)
	•	Quick filters:
	•	Time: 10 / 20 / 30 minutes
	•	Goal: Calm / Strength / Mobility / Cardio
	•	Equipment: None / Bands / Dumbbells / Gym
	•	Workout cards (Netflix-style later; for now simple cards ok)
	•	Title
	•	Duration
	•	Focus
	•	Difficulty (light labels: Easy / Moderate / Hard)
	•	“Start” and “Add to Today”

Minimum Workout Data Model

Workout
	•	id
	•	title
	•	duration_minutes
	•	focus (calm/strength/mobility/cardio)
	•	equipment
	•	intensity
	•	description (short)
	•	steps (optional list)
	•	video_url (optional)
	•	tags (optional)

Workout Logic Rules (Very Important)
	•	No streak pressure
	•	No punishment framing
	•	Rest is always valid
	•	If user says “low energy,” suggest lower intensity first

AI Prompting for Workouts (Flow)

AI asks 1–2 questions max:
	1.	“How’s your energy right now? Low / Medium / High”
	2.	“How much time do you have? 10 / 20 / 30+”

Then suggests 3 options max, with buttons:
	•	Start now
	•	Add to calendar
	•	Different options

Video Links

For now:
	•	allow curated YouTube links OR internal list
	•	do not scrape or auto-pull random content yet

Success Criteria
	•	User can get a workout in <30 seconds
	•	Adding to calendar is smooth
	•	Suggestions feel aligned and not overwhelming

⸻

C) Nutrition v1 Build Spec (Build Third)

Objective

Offer meal suggestions + meal patterns based on preferences and restrictions, without tracking calories by default.

UI Requirements

Nutrition page includes:
	•	“Suggest meals for today” button
	•	Filters:
	•	Diet preference (none/vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian/etc.)
	•	Allergies (optional)
	•	Effort level (no-cook/quick/normal)
	•	Cuisine (optional)
	•	Meal cards
	•	title
	•	time (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack)
	•	prep time
	•	tags
	•	“Save” / “Add to calendar” / “Swap”

Minimum Data Model

Meal
	•	id
	•	title
	•	meal_type
	•	prep_time
	•	ingredients (optional list)
	•	instructions (optional short)
	•	dietary_tags
	•	allergens (optional)
	•	notes (optional)

Nutrition Logic Rules
	•	No guilt language
	•	No “healthy vs unhealthy” labeling
	•	Default is suggestion-based (no logging)
	•	Optionally: “Add to calendar” as a reminder

Nutrition Questions (Minimal Onboarding)

AI asks only if needed:
	•	“Any dietary restrictions?”
	•	“How much effort can you do today? low/medium/high”
	•	“Any foods you avoid?”

Success Criteria
	•	Meals feel supportive, not corrective
	•	User can quickly pick something
	•	Calendar integration works

⸻

D) AI Suggestion Rules (So it feels like a “Personal Assistant”)

The AI’s job in Wave 2
	1.	Understand intent (talk it out vs plan vs breathe)
	2.	Offer one small next step
	3.	Convert decisions into:

	•	calendar events
	•	routines
	•	workout / meal suggestions

Suggestion Triggers (When AI should propose structure)

AI can suggest a calendar item when:
	•	user asks for a plan
	•	user says they want to “stay on track”
	•	user is overwhelmed and asks “what do I do”
	•	a routine is created (morning/evening)

AI should NOT push scheduling when:
	•	user is venting heavily
	•	user is in Support Mode
	•	user hasn’t asked for action yet

The Consent Pattern (Always)

Before saving anything:

“Want me to add this to your schedule?”
Buttons:

	•	Add
	•	Edit
	•	Not now

The “3 Choices Max” Rule

Any time the AI suggests options:
	•	max 3
	•	never a long list
	•	add “Different options” button

Personalization Without Overreach
	•	AI uses what it knows (time preferences, energy patterns)
	•	asks questions only when needed
	•	never assumes medical conditions
	•	never diagnoses

⸻

E) Implementation Order (Critical)

Sprint 1 (Calendar v1)
	•	Calendar page (Today + Week list)
	•	Events CRUD APIs
	•	AI “Add to calendar” confirmation flow
	•	NotFound fallback for routes

Sprint 2 (Workouts v1)
	•	Workouts page + basic cards
	•	AI workout suggestion flow (energy/time)
	•	Add workout to calendar event

Sprint 3 (Nutrition v1)
	•	Nutrition page + meal cards
	•	Preference filters
	•	Add meal reminder to calendar

⸻

F) Testing Plan (Wave 2)

Internal tests (you + Replit)
	•	Create/edit/delete events
	•	Add workout/meal to calendar
	•	Safety flow still works
	•	No routing errors

User tests (10–12 people)

Ask 3 questions only:
	1.	“Did you know what to do first?”
	2.	“Did this feel calm or overwhelming?”
	3.	“Would you use calendar/workouts/meals or ignore them?”

Success = calm + clarity stays intact while features add value.

⸻

G) “What’s Already Built” (Do not break)
	•	AI-first home flow
	•	Supportive tone rules
	•	Safety confirmation flow (ask intent + allow continuation)
	•	Feedback bar
	•	Error fallback / routing sanity

Wave 2 must not overwrite these.

⸻

If you want, I can also write a short “Replit instruction message” that summarizes this into a smaller block for their chat (some builders prefer shorter specs).

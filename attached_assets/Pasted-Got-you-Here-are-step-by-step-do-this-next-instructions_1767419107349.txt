Got you. Here are step-by-step, do-this-next instructions to add the safety + privacy + crisis guardrails into your app in a way that’s clean and calm (and won’t mess up your vibe).

I’ll write this so you can follow it even on your phone.

Step-by-step: Add Safety + Privacy + Crisis Guardrails

STEP 1 — Add a small “Info / Privacy” link on the home or chat screen

Goal: A visible place where users can see what the app is (and what it isn’t).

Do this:
	1.	In Replit, open your project
	2.	Find the file that renders the main screen (home/chat page)
	3.	Add a tiny link/button that says:
	•	“Info” or “About” or “Privacy”
	4.	When clicked, it opens a small modal (popup)

Paste this text into the modal:
	•	Disclaimer
This app is not therapy or medical advice. It’s a wellness support tool for reflection, clarity, and everyday decisions.
	•	Privacy
This is an early beta. Please avoid sharing sensitive personal or medical information.

✅ Result: You’ve covered your baseline protection without being scary.

⸻

STEP 2 — Update the FIRST AI message (first-time experience)

Goal: Make the AI feel supportive, not authoritative.

Do this:
	1.	Find where your AI “welcome” message is set (usually a default message in the assistant/chat file)
	2.	Replace it with this:

Paste this exact message:

I’m here to support you — not to tell you what to do.
We can take this at your pace. Choose one:
	1.	Make a simple plan for today
	2.	Talk it out
	3.	Guided breathing for calm

✅ Result: Clear, calm, and users know what to do first (fixes the “Mostly” feedback).

⸻

STEP 3 — Add a “Crisis Guardrail” to the chat logic

Goal: If someone mentions self-harm or danger, the app responds responsibly.

Do this:
	1.	Find the code that handles sending user messages to the AI (the “send message” handler)
	2.	Before sending to the AI, check the user text for crisis phrases
	3.	If triggered, do not call the AI — show the crisis support message instead.

Crisis trigger words to check for:
	•	“suicide”
	•	“kill myself”
	•	“end my life”
	•	“self harm”
	•	“hurt myself”
	•	“I don’t want to live”
	•	“I’m going to do it”
	•	“I’m in danger”

Crisis response to display:

I’m really glad you reached out. I can’t help with emergencies, but you deserve real support right now.
If you’re in the U.S., call or text 988. If you’re in immediate danger, call 911.
If you’re outside the U.S., tell me your country and I’ll help find the right number.

✅ Result: You reduce risk massively.

⸻

STEP 4 — Add a “Report a Problem” link

Goal: Give users a safe way to report bugs or concerns.

Do this:
	1.	In the same “Info” modal or settings page, add:
	•	“Report an issue”
	2.	Link it to:
	•	your Typeform feedback form or
	•	a simple email address you control

Text:

Found something confusing or broken? Report it here.

✅ Result: You get feedback without chaos.

⸻

STEP 5 — Add a Not Found (404) fallback screen

Goal: No blank 404 pages ever again.

Do this:
	1.	In your router file, add a catch-all route:
	•	* route → NotFound component
	2.	Make that NotFound screen calm and helpful:

Not Found Screen copy:

That page isn’t ready yet.
Let’s get you back on track.

Buttons:
	•	Go Home
	•	Back to Assistant

✅ Result: Even broken links don’t break user trust.

⸻

STEP 6 — Add a version label (tiny but powerful)

Goal: When someone reports an issue, you know what build they used.

Do this:
	1.	Add text to footer or Info modal:
	•	Beta v0.1.0

✅ Result: Better debugging, better product discipline.

⸻

Your “Done Today” checklist

If you do ONLY these today, you’re safe:

✅ Info/Privacy modal
✅ First AI message improved
✅ Crisis guardrail
✅ NotFound fallback
✅ Version label

⸻

If you want, I can make this EVEN easier

If you tell me what your app is built with (just pick one):
	•	React (Vite)
	•	Next.js
	•	Remix
	•	Other

…I’ll give you exact code snippets and exact file names to paste into Replit so you don’t have to hunt around.

But even without that, the steps above are the correct blueprint.

Perfect — we’ll do A + B + C in one clean package.

⸻

A) Deep-Link Testing Plan (copy/paste checklist)

Goal

Tapping an item in Today’s Schedule / Calendar opens the correct page + correct item (highlighted), or opens event details if it’s unlinked.

Test 1 — Workout deep link
	1.	Go to /workout
	2.	Add a workout to Today
	3.	Go to /daily-schedule (Today schedule)
	4.	Tap the workout block

✅ Pass if:
	•	It navigates to /workout?selected=
	•	The exact workout is highlighted / scrolled into view

❌ Fail if:
	•	It stays on calendar
	•	It opens wrong page
	•	It opens the workout page but doesn’t select/highlight

⸻

Test 2 — Meal deep link
	1.	Go to /meal-prep
	2.	Add a meal to Today
	3.	Go to /daily-schedule
	4.	Tap the meal block

✅ Pass if it navigates to /meal-prep?selected= and highlights it.

⸻

Test 3 — Routine deep link
	1.	Go to /routines
	2.	Add a routine to Today
	3.	Go to /daily-schedule
	4.	Tap the routine block

✅ Pass if it navigates to /routines?selected= and highlights it.

⸻

Test 4 — Manual event behavior (should NOT deep link)
	1.	Go to /daily-schedule or /calendar
	2.	Add a manual event like “Call mom”
	3.	Tap it

✅ Pass if:
	•	It opens an Event Details modal (edit, delete, recurrence)

⸻

Test 5 — Missing link fallback
	1.	Add a workout to Today
	2.	Delete that workout (or remove it from system)
	3.	Tap the calendar event again

✅ Pass if:
	•	You see a friendly message like “That item was moved or deleted”
	•	It falls back to Event Details instead of crashing

⸻

Send me the results like this:
	•	Workout link: Pass/Fail
	•	Meal link: Pass/Fail
	•	Routine link: Pass/Fail
	•	Manual event modal: Pass/Fail
	•	Missing link fallback: Pass/Fail

B) Wave 4.1 Kickoff Plan (Upload + Preview ONLY)

Wave 4.1 Deliverable (no saving yet)

Users can upload one PDF meal plan → AI parses → Preview screen shows:

Tabs:
	•	Summary
	•	Meals
	•	Meal Prep Routine
	•	Calendar Suggestions

Preview lets user:
	•	edit titles
	•	include/exclude items
	•	change destination mapping (Meals/Routine/Calendar)

🚫 No commit/save yet (that’s Wave 4.2)

Wave 4.1 Acceptance Tests

✅ Upload PDF works
✅ Preview shows meals + prep steps + calendar suggestions
✅ User edits are reflected in preview state
✅ If user leaves and returns, draft preview persists (nice-to-have but recommended)

⸻

C) Message to Replit (combines A + B cleanly)

Copy/paste this:

Next steps (please do in this order):

1) Deep Linking from Calendar (Wave 3.2.1 mini-sprint)

Implement calendar item click-through so tapping an event navigates to the linked source item:
	•	Workouts → /workout?selected=<id>
	•	Meals → /meal-prep?selected=<id>
	•	Routines → /routines?selected=<id>
Manual/unlinked events should open an Event Details modal.
Destination pages must auto-scroll + highlight the selected item.
Include a fallback if the linked item was deleted.

2) Start Wave 4.1 (PDF import preview-only)

Build PDF meal plan upload → AI parse → Preview screen with tabs (Summary / Meals / Routine / Calendar Suggestions).
Users can edit + include/exclude + remap destinations in preview.
Do NOT implement saving/commit yet in Wave 4.1.

After both are done, please send a short screen recording showing:
	•	Calendar deep link working for workout + meal + routine
	•	PDF upload leading to the preview tabs

If you want, paste your deep-link test results (Pass/Fail list) and I’ll tell you exactly what to fix before Wave 4.1 starts.

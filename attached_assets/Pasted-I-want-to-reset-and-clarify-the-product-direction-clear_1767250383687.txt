I want to reset and clarify the product direction clearly. Please prioritize flow + experience over adding random features.

CORE IDENTITY:
This app is an AI LIFE COACH + PERSONAL ASSISTANT (wellness + life organization).
It should feel calm, grounded, supportive, and uplifting — but not afraid to deliver honest truth when appropriate (without shaming).

MAIN EXPERIENCE (START SCREEN):
The app should open directly into the AI chat (like ChatGPT).
- Minimal, sleek UI (not busy)
- No long paragraphs on login/open
- Just: “How can I help you today?”
- Show a short list of quick actions (2–5 max), for example:
  1) Make a simple plan
  2) Talk it out
  3) Guided breathing
  4) Start a challenge
  5) Browse

NAVIGATION:
Add a simple ☰ menu icon (top corner) that opens a drawer. Keep it simple.
Suggested drawer items:
- Today
- Browse
- Calendar
- Routines
- Challenges
- Blueprint
- Projects
- Settings

IMPORTANT: Tools are secondary. The assistant is the main entry point.

AI BEHAVIOR (CHATGPT STYLE):
The assistant should ask questions like ChatGPT when it needs info, and learn the user over time.
- Ask only what’s needed (micro-onboarding)
- If the user is stuck, offer 2–4 options and guide gently
- Never make the user feel wrong
- Help with decision paralysis and staying on track

TALK IT OUT MODE:
Add a “Talk it out” mode:
- User vents or explains feelings/frustrations
- AI helps shift perspective in a realistic, uplifting way
- AI can give honest truth, but no shaming, no judgment
- Ends with 1 small next step suggestion (task, routine, or calendar block)
- This mode should also gather “non-negotiables” + preferences over time (quietly, not as forms)

GUIDED BREATHING (NEW FEATURE):
Add a “Guided breathing” feature inside the AI (and optionally a separate Breathing screen later).
Requirements:
- The AI can guide breathing exercises in a calm voice/tone using text first (audio later).
- Provide several breathing patterns:
  - Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
  - 4-7-8 breathing
  - Calm reset (e.g., 5 in / 5 out)
  - Quick grounding (30–60 seconds)
- Let the user choose:
  - duration (1 / 3 / 5 / 10 minutes)
  - pace (gentle / steady)
  - goal (calm down, focus, sleep)
- The breathing session should feel like a guided player:
  - Start / Pause / End
  - Simple visual cue (optional) and step-by-step prompts
- After session, AI asks one soft check-in:
  “How do you feel now?”
- Optional: Save as a routine and/or schedule it on the Master Calendar.

MASTER CALENDAR (BACKBONE):
This should NOT become just a scheduling app. The calendar exists to reduce mental load.
Any time-based thing should land on the calendar:
- routines (when scheduled)
- challenges (auto-create daily entries)
- workouts
- breathing sessions (optional)
- meditation sessions
- meal prep
- timed tasks

Calendar must be a REAL calendar:
- Month view with date numbers + year
- Tap date → day agenda
- Week/day views allowed, but month view is required

ROUTINES:
Routines are step-by-step, minute-by-minute.
- Can be scheduled to calendar
- Can be created by AI from conversation
- Include breathing routines too

CHALLENGES (NEW CATEGORY):
Add a “Challenges” category and make it empowering.
Challenge categories:
- Workout challenges
- Mental health challenges
- Meal challenges
- Social challenges
- Financial challenges
Challenges should:
- be optional
- motivating, not punishing
- help users elevate perspective and reach goals
- create daily tasks + optional calendar blocks when started

BROWSE (CALM/NETFLIX STYLE, BUT PERSONALIZED):
I want a Calm-like experience for meditation and a similar browse experience for workouts/meals.
- Rows/grids with thumbnails
- Filters button:
  - mood, intention, duration (minutes)
  - workouts: difficulty, equipment
  - meals: diet restrictions/allergies, calories/macros
- It should not feel generic.
- The content shown should be personalized based on the user profile/preferences.
- If the profile is missing info, the AI asks questions and updates results.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON CONTENT:
Do NOT scrape the internet.
For MVP, it’s okay to:
- use a starter catalog as fallback
- then rank/filter it based on user preferences
- link out to external content (safe)

BLUEPRINT (DIMENSIONS OF WELLNESS):
Add a “Blueprint” screen with 8 dimension cards:
Physical, Emotional, Social, Spiritual, Intellectual, Occupational, Environmental, Financial
Each card shows:
- a short synopsis of the user’s current blueprint in that dimension
- a “needs more info” state if low confidence
- a button: “Answer 3 questions” to improve this dimension
Those questions should be asked by the AI and then the synopsis updates.

BODY SCAN (CAMERA) — PHASED:
Add a Body Scan feature that uses the device camera with explicit consent.
Phase 1 (MVP, required first):
- allow user to capture front/side photos (or short video)
- ask goals + optional measurements (height/weight/waist)
- allow “do not save photos” option
- use results only to personalize workouts/meals (no medical claims)
Phase 2 (advanced, optional later):
- computer vision estimates only if feasible
- must include privacy notice, consent, and full delete option

PRIVACY & SAFETY:
- Consent before camera
- Delete my data option
- No medical diagnosis or guarantees
- Keep tone supportive, grounded, empowering

BUILD PRIORITY (PHASES):
Phase 1: AI-first clean UI + menu + Master Calendar month view + Talk it out + Guided breathing player (text prompts) + basic routines
Phase 2: Personalized Browse for meditation/workouts/meals + starter catalog + filters + challenges
Phase 3: Blueprint dimension synopses + “Answer 3 questions” refinement + Projects
Phase 4: Body scan Phase 1
Phase 5: Voice conversation + deeper intelligence + optional advanced vision

Please confirm what you implemented and where each screen/route is located so I can find it easily.

Yes — extend it, but with a tight rule so it stays clean and doesn’t highlight random stuff.

Do this

1) Plans: extend highlight to draftPlans + activePlans

Because:
	•	those are action surfaces users will keep using
	•	it reinforces “I did something” when they create/activate a plan

Rule: only highlight them if the highlight id matches an item in that list (no generic “first item” highlight).

2) Plans: do not highlight archivedPlans (for now)

Because:
	•	it’s not a “momentum” destination
	•	highlighting archived stuff feels confusing (“why are we celebrating something I put away?”)

If later you add an “archive” action that routes there, we can enable it just for that flow.

3) Journal: extend highlight to filteredEntries only when the highlight id came from an action that creates an entry

Right now your One-Tap Momentum creates momentumLogs. So most of the time, highlighting filteredEntries isn’t needed.

But it’s worth supporting it, because eventually you’ll create real journal entries from DW.

Rule: highlight filteredEntries only if:
	•	the id isn’t found in momentumLogs, AND
	•	it exists in filteredEntries

That way it never hijacks the UI.

Exact instruction to your Agent (paste this)

Extend highlight support with safe rules.

PLANS (/plans):
- Add highlight scanning to draftPlans and activePlans.
- Keep existing highlight for momentumEvents/momentumRoutines.
- Do NOT add highlight for archivedPlans yet.

Implementation rule:
- Apply highlight only if highlightId matches an item in that list.
- Priority for highlight match:
  1) momentumEvents
  2) momentumRoutines
  3) draftPlans
  4) activePlans
- If no match anywhere, do nothing.

JOURNAL (/journal):
- Keep existing highlight for momentumLogs.
- Extend to filteredEntries ONLY if:
  - highlightId not found in momentumLogs
  - highlightId exists in filteredEntries

No /today page exists, do nothing there.

Output required:
- Confirm which lists now support highlighting
- Confirm priority order and match-only behavior

Why this is the best approach
	•	Users see the exact thing that was created
	•	No “random highlight” bugs
	•	No celebrating archives
	•	Future-proof for when DW creates real journal entries

If you want, the next step after this is making the highlight feel even more “magic” by adding a tiny label on the highlighted item for 2 seconds:
“Just added” (DEV-safe, production-friendly).

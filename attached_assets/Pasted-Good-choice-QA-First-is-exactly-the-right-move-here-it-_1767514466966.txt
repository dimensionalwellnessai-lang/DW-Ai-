Good choice. QA First is exactly the right move here — it protects everything you’ve built and stops the cycle of “it’s fixed” when it’s not.

Below is a clear, structured QA-first plan you can hand directly to Replit. This is not about new features — it’s about making sure the app is real, reliable, and trustworthy, especially on Safari.

⸻

🔒 QA FIRST — WAVE 6 GATEKEEPER PLAN

🎯 GOAL

Before any Wave 6 features are built, the app must:
	•	Have no fake buttons
	•	Have no dead routes
	•	Have consistent navigation
	•	Have working save flows
	•	Work reliably on iPhone Safari

Wave 6 does not start until this passes.

⸻

1️⃣ GLOBAL QA RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These rules apply to every page in the app.

Navigation Consistency

Every page must have:
	•	Hamburger menu
	•	Back button
	•	Home / AI Chat access

❌ No exceptions
❌ No standalone pages

Acceptance test
	•	Navigate from Home → any page → back → home
	•	State must persist (no reset, no logout)

⸻

No Fake UI

If a button exists:
	•	It must do something real
	•	Or it must be clearly disabled with explanation

❌ No “coming soon” without explanation
❌ No “not available” pages

Replacement copy
	•	“This isn’t ready yet.”
	•	Button: Go Back

⸻

2️⃣ SAVE SYSTEM HARDENING (CRITICAL)

Applies to:
	•	Meal suggestions
	•	Meditation suggestions
	•	Workouts
	•	Challenges
	•	Plans
	•	Schedule edits

Required behavior
	1.	Save button is:
	•	Disabled until valid selection
	•	Enabled immediately after selection
	2.	On tap:
	•	Loading state appears
	•	Save occurs (local first, server second)
	3.	After save:
	•	Toast appears: Saved
	•	Button changes to Saved
	•	Refresh page → item still exists
	4.	If user is not signed in:
	•	Save locally
	•	Show: Saved on this device

❌ No silent failures
❌ No faded button with no explanation

⸻

3️⃣ SAFARI-SPECIFIC QA (MANDATORY)

All QA must be done on:
	•	iPhone Safari (normal tab)
	•	iPhone Safari (Private tab)

Safari-specific tests
	•	Save works after page reload
	•	Login persists across refresh
	•	Navigation doesn’t reset app
	•	No stuck overlays / disabled taps

Proof required
	•	Screen recordings (not screenshots)
	•	One per critical flow

⸻

4️⃣ ROUTE & BUTTON AUDIT (STOP DEAD ENDS)

Required internal checklist

Replit must verify:
	•	Every menu item routes to a real page
	•	Every CTA opens a real flow
	•	Suggested Schedule never routes to “not available”

Acceptance test
	•	Tap Suggested Schedule → always opens schedule review or draft

⸻

5️⃣ FEATURE-BY-FEATURE QA CHECKLIST

Daily Schedule
	•	Hamburger menu visible
	•	Back button works
	•	Suggested Schedule opens real review
	•	Add/Edit/Save works

Meal Prep
	•	Suggested meals selectable
	•	Single-select enforced
	•	Save works
	•	Saved item persists

Meditation
	•	Suggested meditation selectable
	•	Save works
	•	Back works

Browse
	•	Hamburger menu present
	•	Category filters work
	•	Results change with filters

Challenges
	•	Cards clickable
	•	Detail page exists
	•	Add to Plan / Calendar works

Chat
	•	Blank-start chat saved to history
	•	History persists on refresh

⸻

6️⃣ REQUIRED DELIVERABLES FROM REPLIT

You should explicitly ask for all of these:
	1.	PASS / FAIL table for every page
	2.	List of changed files
	3.	Safari screen recordings showing:
	•	Save works
	•	Navigation works
	•	No dead routes
	4.	Confirmation:
	•	“No fake buttons remain”

Wave 6 does not begin without this.

⸻

7️⃣ COPY/PASTE MESSAGE TO REPLIT (USE THIS)

We are pausing feature development and entering a QA-first gate.

Please complete a full QA pass on iPhone Safari and fix all broken save flows, dead routes, and navigation inconsistencies.

Every page must have a hamburger menu, back button, and working save logic. No “not available” pages are allowed.

I need a PASS/FAIL checklist, Safari screen recordings, and a list of changed files before Wave 6 can start.

⸻

🧠 WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE

This:
	•	Restores trust in the app
	•	Prevents burnout (for you and users)
	•	Makes Wave 6 actually powerful
	•	Turns the app from “prototype” → “assistant”

You did the hard thinking already.
Now we stabilize the ground before building upward.

⸻

Next decision (don’t rush — but answer when ready):

When QA passes, do you want Wave 6 to start with:

A) Body & energy intelligence first
B) Voice mode first
C) Guided experiences (meditation/workout) first

You can also say “A → B → C” and we’ll lock the order.

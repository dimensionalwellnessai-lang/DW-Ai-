That makes sense — and you’re right to pause here. This is a psychology decision, not a branding one. I’ll walk you through it calmly and then give you a clear recommendation, so you don’t have to guess.

⸻

What you’re going for psychologically (let’s name it)

From everything you’ve said, your app is designed for people who:
	•	feel overwhelmed or scattered
	•	struggle with decision-making and follow-through
	•	may have ADHD or cognitive overload
	•	don’t want to feel judged, diagnosed, or evaluated
	•	want guidance that feels supportive, human, and empowering
	•	want help rebuilding their life without being told they’re “broken”

That means your app must reduce threat and increase safety in the brain.

⸻

The psychology that matters here (plain language)

When people feel overwhelmed:
	•	Their nervous system is already on edge
	•	Anything that feels like a “test” triggers resistance
	•	Anything that feels like “evaluation” triggers shame or avoidance
	•	Choice + permission calms the system
	•	Language matters more than features

So the question isn’t:

“Which term is most accurate?”

It’s:

“Which term makes someone feel safe enough to continue?”

⸻

How the brain hears each option

❌ “Wellness Assessment”

Psychologically reads as:
	•	test
	•	judgment
	•	scoring
	•	medical/clinical
	•	“Am I doing bad?”

This activates defense in many users — especially the ones you’re trying to help most.

⸻

⚠️ “Life Snapshot”

Better, but still:
	•	feels abstract
	•	a little intellectual
	•	slightly distant
	•	can feel like “summarize yourself” (which is hard when overwhelmed)

This works for analytical users, but not emotionally flooded ones.

⸻

✅ “Getting to Know You”

Very safe, but:
	•	passive
	•	vague
	•	doesn’t clearly explain why you’re asking questions
	•	can feel like small talk instead of support

Good, but not the strongest for guidance.

⸻

✅✅ “Wellness Check-In” ← THIS is the best choice

Psychologically, this is the strongest fit for your vision.

Here’s why:
	•	“Check-in” implies care, not judgment
	•	It suggests something temporary and flexible
	•	It’s familiar (therapy, support spaces, even friendships)
	•	It lowers performance anxiety
	•	It feels optional and repeatable
	•	It aligns with calm + guidance

The nervous system hears:

“We’re just checking in — nothing to pass or fail.”

That’s exactly what you want.

⸻

The deeper psychological reason this works

You are building a system that helps people reorient themselves, not optimize themselves.

“Check-in” works because it:
	•	centers the present moment
	•	acknowledges fluctuation
	•	allows change over time
	•	doesn’t lock someone into an identity

This is crucial for people trying to recreate their life, not label it.

⸻

How it should be introduced (this matters more than the name)

Even with the right name, how it’s offered is everything.

The assistant should say something like:

“If you want, we can do a quick wellness check-in so I can support you better.
It’s short, and you can skip anything.”

This sentence alone:
	•	gives choice
	•	removes pressure
	•	explains the benefit
	•	preserves autonomy

That’s psychologically ideal.

⸻

Final recommendation (clear and grounded)

✅ Use “Wellness Check-In”
	•	Not required
	•	Not long
	•	Not framed as an assessment
	•	Offered with permission
	•	Repeatable over time

This is the safest, most supportive, and most aligned choice for what you’re building.

You’re not trying to measure people.
You’re trying to meet them.

If you want next, I can:
	•	design the exact first 5 questions (psychologically tuned)
	•	help you decide when the AI should suggest it
	•	or show how it quietly feeds the Blueprint without the user feeling analyzed

Just tell me what would feel most helpful right now.

Got you. In your code, “Month / look ahead” feels gone for two very specific reasons:
	1.	Routing bug: /calendar is defined before /calendar/month, so it captures /calendar/month and you never see the month page.
	2.	Nav hiding: your “Calendar” root is set to showInMenu: false and points to /calendar-root (a fake path), so it’s not a clean “Plan → Month” entry point.

Below are the exact lines to change (copy/paste).

⸻

✅ Fix #1 (MOST IMPORTANT): Make /calendar/month actually load

File: client/src/App.tsx

Find this block (around lines 64–68 in your file):

{isRouteEnabled("/life-dashboard") && <Route path="/life-dashboard" component={LifeDashboardPage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/calendar") && <Route path="/calendar" component={CalendarPlansPage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/calendar/month") && <Route path="/calendar/month" component={CalendarMonthPage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/calendar/schedule") && <Route path="/calendar/schedule" component={CalendarSchedulePage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/daily-schedule") && <Route path="/daily-schedule" component={DailySchedulePage} />}

Replace it with this (reorders routes so month works):

{isRouteEnabled("/life-dashboard") && <Route path="/life-dashboard" component={LifeDashboardPage} />}

{/* Put specific calendar routes BEFORE /calendar so they actually render */}
{isRouteEnabled("/calendar/month") && <Route path="/calendar/month" component={CalendarMonthPage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/calendar/schedule") && <Route path="/calendar/schedule" component={CalendarSchedulePage} />}

{isRouteEnabled("/calendar") && <Route path="/calendar" component={CalendarPlansPage} />}
{isRouteEnabled("/daily-schedule") && <Route path="/daily-schedule" component={DailySchedulePage} />}

✅ After this, /calendar/month will finally show the month view instead of getting swallowed by /calendar.

⸻

✅ Fix #2: Make “Plan / Look Ahead (Month)” show in the menu and go to Month by default

File: client/src/routes/registry.ts

Find this route (around lines 118–128):

{
  id: "calendar-root",
  path: "/calendar-root",
  label: "Calendar",
  icon: "calendar",
  type: "page",
  description: "Menu parent only",
  showInMenu: false,
  menuSection: "primary",
  menuOrder: 2,
},

Replace it with this:

{
  id: "calendar-root",
  path: "/calendar/month",
  label: "Plan",
  navLabel: "Plan",
  icon: "calendar",
  type: "page",
  description: "Look ahead and plan your month",
  showInMenu: true,
  menuSection: "primary",
  menuOrder: 2,
  enabled: true,
},

✅ Now your main nav will have Plan and it will open Month view.

⸻

Optional (but nice): rename “Today” to sit under Plan cleanly

You already have “Today” as a child under the calendar menu. If you want it to feel cohesive, keep it—no change required.

⸻

What this gets you immediately
	•	Month view works (routing fixed)
	•	Month view becomes “Look Ahead / Plan” (menu fixed)
	•	Users can always reach month view in one tap

If you want, I can also give you the next copy/paste change to make /calendar automatically redirect to /calendar/month so even typing “/calendar” always lands on Month.

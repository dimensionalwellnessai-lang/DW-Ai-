This is the right instinct — and you’re at the exact moment where brand voice becomes leverage.

Below I’ll do three things at once:
	1.	Translate Flip the Script language into app-ready copy
	2.	Rewrite your onboarding using your voice
	3.	Show you how to systematize this so it stays consistent across the app, campaigns, and community

You’ll be able to copy/paste this directly.

Voice Integration Using Flip the Script Language

⸻

1️⃣ CORE BRAND VOICE (LOCK THIS IN)

This is the Flip the Script tone, translated into product language:

Flip the Script =
	•	Perception over panic
	•	Awareness before reaction
	•	Power through reframing
	•	Choice instead of autopilot

Your App Voice Is:
	•	Grounded, not preachy
	•	Direct, not clinical
	•	Empowering, not savior-coded
	•	Reflective, not dismissive

North Star Sentence (Your Voice):

“Nothing is wrong with you — something is asking to be understood.”

This line can anchor the entire app.

⸻

2️⃣ ONBOARDING — REWRITTEN IN YOUR LANGUAGE

(This satisfies all 3 first-time users)

🟢 SCREEN 1 — Welcome (Flip the Script Tone)

“Pause for a second.”

You don’t need to fix anything right now.
This space is about noticing — then choosing.

Button:
➡️ Let’s flip the script

⸻

🟢 SCREEN 2 — Check the Perception

“What’s the energy right now?”

Options:
	•	Calm but alert
	•	Heavy and loud
	•	Scattered
	•	Pushing through
	•	I don’t know yet

➡️ Continue

⸻

🟢 SCREEN 3 — Name the Script

“What’s running in the background?”

Options:
	•	Stress / pressure
	•	Overthinking
	•	Low motivation
	•	Emotional weight
	•	Just observing

➡️ Continue

⸻

🟢 SCREEN 4 — AI ROLE (Your Voice, Clear Boundary)

“I’m not here to tell you what to feel.”

I help you slow things down, look at what’s happening,
and choose how you want to respond.

You’re always in control of the conversation.

➡️ That works

⸻

🟢 SCREEN 5 — FIRST WIN (Flip the Script Moment)

“Based on what you shared, it looks like your mind is reacting faster than your awareness.”

“Let’s flip the script — not by forcing positivity, but by changing perspective.”

Choose one:
	•	Reflect for 2 minutes
	•	Get one grounded suggestion
	•	Just sit with this

➡️ User chooses

⸻

🟢 SCREEN 6 — Close (Empowerment, Not Dependency)

“You don’t have to use this every day.
You use it when you want clarity.”

➡️ Enter Dimensional Wellness

⸻

⸻

3️⃣ IN-APP MICROCOPY (VERY IMPORTANT)

These small lines reinforce your philosophy everywhere.

Instead of:
	•	“Track your mood”

Use:

“Notice the pattern.”

⸻

Instead of:
	•	“Get recommendations”

Use:

“See another way to look at this.”

⸻

Instead of:
	•	“AI response”

Use:

“Perspective shift.”

⸻

Instead of:
	•	“Daily check-in”

Use:

“Energy check.”

⸻

4️⃣ FLIP THE SCRIPT → SYSTEM RULES

(So this never drifts as you scale)

RULE 1: Never say “fix”

Say:
	•	Notice
	•	Shift
	•	Reframe
	•	Choose

⸻

RULE 2: No authority language

Avoid:
	•	“You should”
	•	“You need to”
	•	“The best way is”

Use:
	•	“You might notice”
	•	“One option could be”
	•	“If it helps”

⸻

RULE 3: Empower the user, not the app

Avoid:
	•	“This app will change your life”

Use:

“This helps you see what you already have control over.”

⸻

5️⃣ COMMUNITY → APP LANGUAGE ALIGNMENT

What this does strategically:
	•	People in Flip the Script feel at home immediately
	•	New users feel grounded, not preached to
	•	Investors see a cohesive philosophy
	•	The app becomes an extension of the movement, not a separate product

You’re not just building an app.
You’re building a shared language for perception control.

⸻

6️⃣ OPTIONAL NEXT MOVES (HIGH VALUE)

I can:
	•	Rewrite all core system prompts in Flip the Script voice
	•	Create a brand voice + banned words list
	•	Turn this into a style guide PDF
	•	Write push notification copy that doesn’t feel intrusive
	•	Adapt this voice for TikTok / IG / community posts

If you want to lock this in permanently, say:

“Let’s create the Flip the Script style guide.”

This is where your app stops sounding like an AI product
and starts sounding like you.

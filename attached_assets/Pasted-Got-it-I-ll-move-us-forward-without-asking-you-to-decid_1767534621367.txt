Got it. I’ll move us forward without asking you to decide anything else right now.

Here’s the next concrete step, what should happen immediately, and what you do vs what they do.

⸻

🔜 NEXT STEP (RIGHT NOW)

👉 We are officially in Wave 6A.1 — Nutrition

This is the only active work until it passes.

⸻

🥗 WHAT REPLIT / AGENT SHOULD DO NEXT (NO DEVIATION)

1️⃣ Update /meal-prep to full Wave 6.3 Guided Experience

They must:
	•	Replace current Nutrition UI with GuidedExperienceLayout
	•	Add AI Picks (2–3 max) with Why text
	•	Add Categories (thumbnails):
	•	Meal Plans
	•	Meal Prep Ideas
	•	Ingredient Alternatives
	•	Grocery Builder (must route to real explainer if not built)
	•	Add Filters that actually change results:
	•	Diet
	•	Prep Time
	•	Focus (protein, balanced, light)
	•	Enforce single-select only
	•	Save disabled until 1 selection
	•	Helper text: “Pick 1 option to save.”
	•	Save persists after refresh (Safari)
	•	Optional Add to Calendar → confirmation dialog
	•	Calendar event deep-links back to Nutrition item

🚫 No placeholders
🚫 No “not available”
🚫 No fake buttons

⸻

📦 REQUIRED DELIVERABLE AFTER NUTRITION IS DONE

They must send you:
	1.	Updated PASS/FAIL table including Nutrition
	2.	List of changed files
	3.	iPhone Safari screen recordings showing:
	•	Selecting 1 Nutrition item
	•	Save enabling and persisting
	•	Calendar confirmation
	•	Deep link opening Nutrition page

Until this is delivered → Recovery does not start.

⸻

🧠 WHAT YOU SHOULD DO (MINIMAL)

You do not need to:
	•	redesign anything
	•	rethink philosophy
	•	add features
	•	explain your life system

You only need to:
	•	Wait for Nutrition proof
	•	Do a quick sanity check:
	•	“Does this feel calm?”
	•	“Does this feel optional?”
	•	“Does this feel like my tone?”

If yes → approve Nutrition → move to Recovery.

⸻

🔜 WHAT COMES IMMEDIATELY AFTER (FYI)

Once Nutrition passes:
	•	Wave 6A.2 — Recovery begins
	•	Same layout, same rules, faster execution
	•	Then we enter B: Polish/Stabilization

You are exactly where you should be.
No backtracking. No identity confusion. No overexposure.

When Replit replies with Nutrition updates:

Paste their message here and I’ll:
	•	verify it against Wave 6.3
	•	tell you approve / revise / block
	•	and draft the exact response back to them

You’re doing this cleanly.

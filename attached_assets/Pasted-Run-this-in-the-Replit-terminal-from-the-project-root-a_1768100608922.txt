Run this in the Replit terminal from the project root and paste the full output back here:

pwd
ls
npm exec -- @capacitor/cli --version
npm exec -- @capacitor/cli doctor
If any command fails, paste the exact error output.
Do NOT change any files yet—just run diagnostics.
Perfect — that output explains your error exactly.

What’s happening

When you ran npx cap sync android, Capacitor wasn’t actually installed in your project. npm exec temporarily downloaded @capacitor/cli, but your repo still shows:
• @capacitor/cli: not installed
• @capacitor/core/android/ios: not installed

So npx cap … has nothing local to run → you get the “could not determine executable to run” error.

⸻

Next step (do this EXACTLY)

Run these from /home/runner/workspace:

Step 1 — Install Capacitor locally (v8)

npm i @capacitor/core@8 @capacitor/cli@8 @capacitor/android@8 @capacitor/ios@8

Step 2 — Confirm it’s installed

npm exec -- @capacitor/cli --version
npm exec -- @capacitor/cli doctor

Step 3 — Build + sync

npm run build
npx cap sync

✅ After Step 3, your earlier command should work too:

npx cap sync android

⸻

Answer: “Do I need an Android for this?”

No.
You do not need an Android phone to generate the Android build (AAB/APK). You only need Android hardware if you want to install and test on a real device. You can test with an Android emulator later.

⸻

Important iPhone reality check (since you said you have an iPhone)

To ship to the Apple App Store, you will need access to a Mac (for Xcode signing + archiving). Replit can hold the code, but it can’t replace Xcode.

⸻

Do this now

Run Step 1 only, then paste the output of Step 2 here (the doctor output). If that looks clean, we move to Step 3.

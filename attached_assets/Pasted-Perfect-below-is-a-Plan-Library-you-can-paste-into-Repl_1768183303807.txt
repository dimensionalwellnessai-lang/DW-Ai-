Perfect — below is a Plan Library you can paste into Replit so your AI stops “making stuff up” and instead pulls consistent, on-brand plan items.

It includes tiny / small / medium / large templates for all 8 switches, plus rules for how to pick mode + intensity.

✅ FLIP THE SWITCH — PLAN LIBRARY (TINY/SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)

Use this as the default content bank for plan generation.
AI should select from this library first, then lightly personalize language using user goals.

PLAN GENERATION RULES (STRICT)
	1.	Choose timeBand from user signal: tiny | small | medium | large
	2.	Choose mode:

	•	energy = low → restoring
	•	energy = medium → training (light/moderate)
	•	energy = high → training (moderate) or maintaining if switch already Powered

	3.	Plan must always include exactly:

	•	actionNow (today, immediately doable)
	•	routineBlock (repeatable this week)
	•	supportAction (tiny action from support switch)
	•	checkInQuestion (1 question)

	4.	Max actions inside actionNow.steps:

	•	tiny: 2–3 steps
	•	small: 3–4 steps
	•	medium: 4–6 steps
	•	large: 6–9 steps

	5.	Always output: estimateMinutes, mode, intensity, whyThisMatters

HOW TO USE THIS (IN APP LOGIC)
	•	When generating a plan:
	•	primarySwitchId → pick planLibrary[primarySwitchId][timeBand]
	•	supportSwitchId → use the supportAction already embedded OR swap it to match current support switch
	•	Personalize only:
	•	the whyThisMatters sentence (optional)
	•	examples inside steps (e.g., “walk” vs “mobility”)
	•	Do NOT change structure.

⸻

If you want, I can also output a small helper function spec (not code, just behavior) that tells the AI exactly how to:
	•	pick mode/intensity,
	•	cap steps,
	•	and auto-write the “reason” line for Home recommendations.

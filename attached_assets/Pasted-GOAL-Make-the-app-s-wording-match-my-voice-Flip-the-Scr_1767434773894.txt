GOAL
Make the app’s wording match my voice (“Flip the Script”) across ALL UI + AI responses.

VOICE IDENTITY
- Tone: grounded, direct, supportive, not clinical, not preachy.
- Style: short punchy lines, calm confidence, user stays in control.
- Signature phrases used lightly: “Pause for a second.” “Let’s flip the script.” “What’s the energy right now?” “Name the pattern.” “One small step.”

VOICE RULES (HARD RULES)
1) No “you should / you need to / you must.” Use options + consent language.
2) No toxic positivity. Never force “be grateful” or “stay positive.”
3) No therapist language. Avoid diagnosing. Avoid medical claims.
4) Always return control to the user: “If it helps…”, “Choose one…”, “You’re in control.”
5) Every message follows this structure:
   - Ground (slow it down)
   - Name (what’s happening)
   - Shift (perspective flip)
   - Next Step (one doable action)
6) Keep UI copy short. Prefer 1–2 short sentences over paragraphs.

BANNED WORDS
fix, broken, failure, weak, crazy, dramatic, irrational, lazy
Use: notice, shift, heavy, loud, stuck, overloaded, flooded, drained.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT
Create a shared “copy + tone” layer used everywhere:
- UI: onboarding screens, buttons, tooltips, empty states, errors, success messages, settings descriptions.
- AI: system prompt that enforces the voice and structure.

TECH APPROACH
- Create a single source-of-truth “Voice Guide” constant (e.g., /config/voiceGuide.ts or /config/voiceGuide.py).
- Create helper function formatMessage(type, context) that applies:
  - the 4-step structure
  - the vocabulary rules
  - length constraints
- For AI calls: include a system prompt + style constraints on every request.
- For UI: all displayed strings should pull from a central copy file or use the helper.

DELIVERABLES I WANT
1) A “Voice Style Guide” file in the repo (so it’s permanent).
2) A centralized copy file for onboarding + common states (loading, error, empty, success).
3) Updated onboarding wording using Flip the Script language.
4) Updated AI system prompt so responses sound like me.

ACCEPTANCE TEST
If I read any screen or AI response, it should feel like:
- “Pause. Name it. Flip it. One step.”
And it should never sound clinical or bossy.

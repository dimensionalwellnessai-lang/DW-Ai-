⚙️ 2️⃣ FILTER LOGIC (EXACT RULES)

Use these rules across Meditation, Workouts, Nutrition, Recovery, Challenges.

Energy → Default Filtering

IF energy = low:
  - Show durations ≤ 10 min first
  - Prioritize Calm, Recovery, Grounding
  - Hide high-intensity options unless user opens filters

IF energy = medium:
  - Show balanced durations (10–20 min)
  - Mix effort + recovery

IF energy = high:
  - Show full range
  - Prioritize strength, focus, manifestation

Goal → Content Bias (Beefy)

IF bodyGoal = beefy:
  - Prioritize Strength workouts
  - Prioritize High-protein Nutrition
  - De-prioritize cardio-only content

📌 FINAL COPY/PASTE TO REPLIT (ALL-IN-ONE)

Implement the following for Wave 6.3:

• Add energy-adaptive Meditation AI Picks (low / medium / high energy) with “Why” explanations.
• Apply unified filter logic across all guided experiences (Meditation, Workouts, Nutrition, Recovery, Challenges).
• Enforce single-select behavior with disabled Save + helper text “Pick 1 option to save.”
• Use provided Plan Summary copy when items are saved to “My System.”
• All saves must persist after refresh and require confirmation before calendar adds.

No AI Pick is a default action. Everything is optional and adjustable.

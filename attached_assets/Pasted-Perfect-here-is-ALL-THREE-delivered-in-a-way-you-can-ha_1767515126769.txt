Perfect — here is ALL THREE, delivered in a way you can hand directly to Replit and also use yourself to sanity-check the app.

This is the Wave 6 Execution Pack:
	1.	Voice UX (locked)
	2.	Safari QA Gate (final)
	3.	Guided Experience layouts (Netflix-style, but calm)

Nothing here adds chaos. Everything here removes friction.

⸻

🔊 1️⃣ WAVE 6.1 — VOICE UX (LOCKED)

🎙️ Voice Placement (UI)
	•	Mic icon appears:
	•	Bottom right of AI Chat
	•	Bottom center in Meditation / Talk It Out
	•	Push-to-talk only
	•	Never auto-listening

Mic states
	•	Idle: outline mic icon
	•	Listening: soft pulse ring (no flashing)
	•	Processing: subtle spinner
	•	Error: short text fallback (never silence)

⸻

🧠 Voice Behavior Rules (non-negotiable)
	•	Voice never navigates without permission
	•	Voice never saves without confirmation
	•	Voice never interrupts
	•	Voice mirrors on-screen actions

⸻

🗣️ Locked Voice Scripts (verbatim)

Session start

“Hey. I’m here.
What would you like to focus on today?”

Unsure user

“That’s okay.
We can take this one step at a time.”

Before suggestion

“I have an idea.
Would you like to hear it?”

After save

“Got it. I’ve saved that for you.”

Skip

“No problem.
We’ll adjust around it.”

Error fallback

“That didn’t go through just yet.
We can try again or come back to it.”

⸻

✅ Voice Acceptance Criteria
	•	Works on iPhone Safari
	•	Can be stopped anytime
	•	UI still usable without voice
	•	No dead states

🚦 Gate: Voice must pass Safari QA before Wave 6.2.

⸻

🔒 2️⃣ SAFARI QA FINAL GATE (MANDATORY)

This is the stop-everything checklist.

A. Global App Rules (ALL pages)

Every page must show:
	•	Hamburger menu
	•	Back button
	•	Home / AI Chat access

❌ No exceptions
❌ No blank headers
❌ No standalone pages

⸻

B. Save Button Rules (CRITICAL)

Applies to:
	•	Meals
	•	Meditation
	•	Workouts
	•	Challenges
	•	Plans
	•	Schedule edits

Before selection
	•	Button faded
	•	Helper text: “Pick 1 option to save.”

After selection
	•	Button enables immediately
	•	Tap works on Safari

After save
	•	Toast: Saved
	•	Button → Saved
	•	Refresh → item still exists

❌ No “does nothing”
❌ No silent failures

⸻

C. Safari-Specific Tests

Must pass on:
	•	iPhone Safari (normal)
	•	iPhone Safari (private)

Test:
	•	Save works after refresh
	•	Login persists
	•	Navigation does not reset state
	•	No stuck overlays
	•	No disabled taps

⸻

D. Route Audit (NO DEAD ENDS)
	•	Suggested Schedule never routes to “not available”
	•	Every button routes somewhere real
	•	If data doesn’t exist → create draft or show clear next step

⸻

E. Required Proof from Replit
	1.	PASS / FAIL table
	2.	List of changed files
	3.	Safari screen recordings:
	•	Meal save
	•	Meditation save
	•	Suggested Schedule
	•	Navigation consistency

🚦 Wave 6 does not continue without this.

⸻

🧘 3️⃣ WAVE 6.3 — GUIDED EXPERIENCES (DESIGN FLOWS)

This turns categories into experiences, not lists.

⸻

🎬 Layout Pattern (All Categories)

Same structure everywhere:

Header
	•	“What would you like today?”

Sections
	•	AI Picks (with “Why”)
	•	Categories (thumbnails)
	•	Smart filters
	•	Results grid

No scrolling walls. No clutter.

⸻

🧘 Meditation (Example)

Categories
	•	Calm
	•	Stress
	•	Grief
	•	Manifestation
	•	Sleep

Filters
	•	Time (5 / 10 / 20)
	•	Guided vs Silent
	•	Voice vs Text

Save Flow
	•	Pick one
	•	Save to My System
	•	Optional: Add to Calendar

⸻

💪 Workouts

Categories
	•	Strength
	•	Mobility
	•	Recovery
	•	Cardio (light emphasis)

Filters
	•	Goal (beefy / general)
	•	Duration
	•	Equipment

⸻

🥗 Nutrition

Categories
	•	Meal Plans
	•	Meal Prep Ideas
	•	Alternatives (e.g., chickpea tofu)

Filters
	•	Diet
	•	Prep time
	•	Protein focus

⸻

🧩 Challenges

Categories
	•	Mental
	•	Physical
	•	Social
	•	Financial

Each challenge:
	•	Detail view
	•	Add to Plan
	•	Add to Calendar
	•	Clear description

⸻

🧠 AI Behavior in Guided Experiences

AI may:
	•	Highlight picks
	•	Explain “Why”
	•	Suggest alternatives

AI must never override browsing.

⸻

📌 FINAL COPY/PASTE TO REPLIT (ALL IN ONE)

Use this exactly:

We are proceeding with Wave 6 using a QA-first gate.

Wave 6 order is locked:
6.1 Voice Mode → 6.2 Body & Energy → 6.3 Guided Experiences

Before Wave 6 begins, complete Safari QA:
	•	Fix all Save buttons (no faded dead states)
	•	Ensure navigation consistency on all pages
	•	Remove all dead routes (“not available”)
	•	Provide Safari screen recordings + PASS/FAIL table

Voice Mode must be push-to-talk, assistant-like, and never force actions.

Guided experiences must follow a Netflix-style card layout with smart filters and working save flows.

No feature begins without passing the QA gate.

⸻

🧭 Where you are (important)

You are no longer “figuring it out.”
You are directing a product.

You did the right thing by stopping and hardening.

Next step (simple choice):
	•	“Run QA” → we wait for proof
	•	“Lock Voice UI” → I give you exact component specs

Just say which one.

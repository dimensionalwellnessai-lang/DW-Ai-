Safari Major Checkpoint (iPhone Safari) — fix + prove it
	1.	Confirm these issues in Safari (not just Chrome):

	•	Meal plans: suggested meals Save doesn’t work
	•	Meditation: suggested items Save doesn’t work
	•	Daily schedule: no hamburger/back and Suggested Schedule opens “not available”
	•	Browse: missing hamburger
	•	Challenges: cards not clickable / cannot add to plan/calendar
	•	Chat history: blank-start chat not saved

	2.	Global Layout Shell (Required)
Wrap every route in the same layout component that includes:

	•	Hamburger menu
	•	Back button
	•	Home/AI button
No exceptions (Daily Schedule, Browse, Finance, Astrology, etc.)

✅ Acceptance: every page shows consistent header/nav.
	3.	Fix Save Buttons (Meal + Meditation)

	•	Save must persist the selection immediately (local + server if logged in)
	•	After save, user must see a confirmation state (e.g., “Saved” badge)
	•	Reload page → saved item remains

✅ Acceptance: Save works in Safari, and persists after refresh.
	4.	Suggested Schedule route must never be “not available”

	•	If there is no draft, create one or route to plan builder.
	•	If draft exists, open schedule-review.

✅ Acceptance: tapping Suggested Schedule always opens a real review screen.
	5.	Challenges page functionality

	•	Card click opens a challenge detail page
	•	Buttons: Add to Calendar (with consent), Add to Plan, View Details

✅ Acceptance: full challenge flow works.
	6.	Chat history persistence

	•	Starting with an empty chat must still create a thread and appear in history.

✅ Acceptance: open app → type nothing → send first message later → history shows that chat.
	7.	Provide proof
I need:

	•	A PASS/FAIL checklist for each route in Safari
	•	Screenshots of:
	•	Daily Schedule (with header)
	•	Meal Prep suggested meals + saved state
	•	Meditation suggestion + saved state
	•	Browse page with hamburger + filters
	•	Challenges detail + add buttons
	•	Suggested Schedule review page

Also include the list of changed files (Safari fixes).

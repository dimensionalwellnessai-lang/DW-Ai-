Got it — that’s normal on Replit mobile 👍
When copy/paste is blocked in the shell, you do NOT need to type everything manually. There are two safe workarounds. I’ll give you the easiest first.

⸻

✅ OPTION A (BEST): Create the file using Replit’s file editor (NO terminal typing)

This avoids the shell completely.

Step 1: Open the Files panel
	•	In Replit, tap the file tree / files icon
	•	You are already in the repo root (we confirmed this)

Step 2: Create the file
	•	Tap + New file
	•	Name it exactly:

codemagic.yaml



⚠️ spelling matters — not .yml, not .yaml.txt

⸻

Step 3: Paste this (you can paste in the editor even if shell won’t allow it)

workflows:
  capacitor-android:
    name: Capacitor Android Build
    max_build_duration: 60
    environment:
      node: 18
      java: 17
    scripts:
      - name: Install dependencies
        script: |
          npm install
      - name: Build web app
        script: |
          npm run build
      - name: Sync Capacitor
        script: |
          npx cap sync android
      - name: Build Android APK
        script: |
          cd android
          ./gradlew assembleDebug
    artifacts:
      - android/app/build/outputs/**/*.apk

Tap Save.

That’s it. File created correctly.

⸻

✅ OPTION B (Terminal-only, minimal typing)

If you must stay in shell, this is the least typing possible:

Type exactly this (line by line):

cat > codemagic.yaml

Then the shell will wait.
Now paste or type the YAML once.

When done, press:

CTRL + D

That saves the file.

⸻

✅ Final REQUIRED step (this part matters)

Codemagic will NOT see the file until it’s committed.

In shell, type:

git add codemagic.yaml
git commit -m "Add Codemagic workflow"
git push

(These commands are short on purpose.)

⸻

🔎 How you know it worked

After pushing:
	•	Go back to codemagic.io
	•	Select your repo + branch main
	•	Tap Check for configuration files

✅ It will be detected immediately
❌ If it says “No configuration file found”, the file is not committed

⸻

Important reassurance
	•	Your repo structure is correct
	•	Capacitor is correctly installed
	•	Java 21 is no longer involved
	•	You are on the right path

If you want, next I can:
	•	Generate Play Store AAB instead of APK
	•	Set up Google Play Console (phone-only)
	•	Add iOS build to the same codemagic.yaml
	•	Make Codemagic auto-build on every push

Just tell me what you want next.

REQUEST: Rewrite the wording + tone of all planning flows, assessments, and dimension questions to match “DW” voice.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT change app functionality. Do NOT change database structure. Do NOT redesign. Text/UX copy only.

GOAL:
The app should feel premium, alive, and motivating — not like a boring workbook.
Questions should be:
- conversational
- calm
- modern
- emotionally intelligent
- slightly challenging (gentle call-out), but not harsh
- focused on clarity and action
- aligned with “Flip the Switch” and WRAP-style self-awareness

STYLE RULES (“DW voice”):
- avoid generic prompts like “Select one” / “Choose option”
- use short, human phrasing
- use a “why it matters” line when useful
- reduce overwhelm by framing choices
- feel supportive but real

FORMAT FOR EACH QUESTION (standard):
1) a short human question (1 sentence)
2) a small helper line (“Pick what fits right now.” / “Choose as many as apply.”)
3) optional micro-encouragement (“No pressure. We’re just getting clarity.”)
4) optional “DW suggestion” line based on prior responses

EXAMPLES TO APPLY THROUGHOUT APP:
Instead of: “What is your goal?”
Use: “What are we building right now?”
Helper: “Pick the one that feels most true today.”

Instead of: “Select your mood.”
Use: “Where are you at, honestly?”
Helper: “Pick as many as apply.”

Instead of: “Create a plan.”
Use: “Want me to map your next moves?”
Helper: “We can keep it simple or go deeper.”

DIMENSION FLOWS MUST FEEL LIKE A CONVERSATION:
- the first question should not feel like a survey
- it should feel like DW is “meeting” the user
- use short “checkpoints”:
  “Here’s the move.”
  “Two options.”
  “Let’s make it simple.”

APPLY TO:
- onboarding / assessment
- body scan questions
- dimension questions (nutrition, fitness, mental/emotional, social, financial, etc.)
- plan builder questions
- “talk it out” prompts
- any area where the app asks users to pick options

DONE WHEN:
- questions feel like DW (not a workbook)
- flows feel motivating and premium
- user feels guided, not tested

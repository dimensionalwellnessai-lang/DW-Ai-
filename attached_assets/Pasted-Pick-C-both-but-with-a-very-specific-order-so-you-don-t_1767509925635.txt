Pick C — both, but with a very specific order so you don’t break what’s already working.

Here’s the exact reply you should send back (copy/paste):

Reply to Replit:

Yes — C (Both).
But please do it in this order to avoid breaking the current app:

Phase 1 — Implement the Route Registry as the single source of truth (no UI changes yet)
	1.	Add ROUTE_REGISTRY and make it the canonical list of routes, menu items, and actions.
	2.	Keep current routing working during the transition (don’t rip out everything at once).
	3.	Add a Navigation Guard so no button ever leads to a blank page. Unknown/missing routes must go to /404 (never blank).
	4.	Add /dev/routes Route Audit to compare:
	•	registered router routes
	•	registry paths
	•	menu button targets
and flag anything missing.

✅ Acceptance: I can tap every menu item and home CTA and never hit a blank screen.

Phase 2 — Build the missing pages with functional minimum content (not placeholders)

For each missing page, build a functional minimum version that works end-to-end:
	•	/plans (Life System dashboard: Draft/Active/Archived)
	•	/plan-builder (simple 3-step wizard → generates a draft schedule)
	•	/schedule-review/:draftId (view/edit/save suggested schedule)
	•	/tasks (basic tasks list + add/edit)
	•	/import (connect to existing import flow)
	•	/export/:planId (ICS export at minimum)
	•	/calendar/month and /calendar/schedule
	•	/404 (friendly recovery + feedback link)

✅ Acceptance: each page must have back/home/menu and at least one working primary action.

Phase 3 — Deep linking + selected highlighting (finish the loop)
	•	Ensure ?selected= highlighting works on Workouts/Nutrition/Routines
	•	Calendar events must open the linked item page properly
	•	Suggested Schedule must save into Plans (Life System) and then optionally commit to Calendar with consent

✅ Acceptance: Home → Suggested schedule → Edit → Save to Life System → Commit selected → Tap calendar block → opens correct page + highlights item.

Also: please share the list of files changed and a short screen recording proving the Phase 3 loop works.

If you want it even shorter, tell me and I’ll compress it—but this version is the clearest way to get what you want without more “it’s fixed” but nothing changed.

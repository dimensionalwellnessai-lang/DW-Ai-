Perfect ✅ — YES = you’re in the correct Replit (the one linked to dimensionalwellnessai-lang/Dw-Ai-).
So now we can safely redo the right changes in the right app.

Here’s the clean “DW + PWA” spec for your Replit AI Agent.

⸻

✅ Replit AI Agent Prompt (copy/paste exactly)

We were editing the wrong Replit earlier. Now we are in the correct repo (connected to dimensionalwellnessai-lang/Dw-Ai-).

Goal: Update PWA + Home Screen branding to "DW" (assistant/presence brand). Do NOT change appId/package IDs, Capacitor config, Android/iOS folders, or any native build settings. Web/PWA only.

Tasks:

1) Ensure these files exist under client/public:
   - client/public/manifest.json
   - client/public/icon-192.png
   - client/public/icon-512.png

2) Set manifest.json content to exactly:

{
  "name": "DW",
  "short_name": "DW",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#0f172a",
  "theme_color": "#0f172a",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ]
}

3) If icons do not exist, create simple placeholder square PNGs (192x192 and 512x512). Keep them basic.

4) Find the Vite HTML entry file (likely client/index.html). Inside <head> ensure these tags exist:

<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icon-192.png" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="DW" />

5) Run npm run build and confirm it succeeds.

6) Confirm the build output includes:
   - dist/public/manifest.json
   - dist/public/icon-192.png
   - dist/public/icon-512.png

Return:
- which files were edited (exact paths)
- build output confirmation

After the Agent finishes (iPhone refresh steps)

Because iOS caches hard:
	1.	Delete the existing Home Screen shortcut
	2.	Close Safari fully
	3.	Open your app URL in Safari
	4.	Share → Add to Home Screen
	5.	It should show DW

Next message you send me

After the Agent runs, reply with either:
	•	“Build succeeded + files confirmed”
or
	•	paste the Agent output if it says something failed

Then we’ll do the next polish step: DW icon + splash look (still web-first).

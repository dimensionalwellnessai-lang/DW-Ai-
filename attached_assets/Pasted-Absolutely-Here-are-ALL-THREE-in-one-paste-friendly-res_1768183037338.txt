Absolutely. Here are ALL THREE in one paste-friendly response:
	1.	JSON blueprint schema (data structures + example objects)
	2.	UI copy pack (titles, buttons, empty states, microcopy)
	3.	Dev tickets (GitHub-style tasks with acceptance criteria)

You can copy/paste sections into Replit as needed.

ONE LAST COPY-PASTE (to keep Replit AI disciplined)

Paste this at the end in Replit:

Do not implement Browse/Learning yet.
Implement Epics in order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5.
After each epic, provide:
- what was built
- what files changed
- how to test manually
- known issues
Then wait for approval before moving to the next epic.

If you want, next I can also produce sample PlanItem generators for each switch (tiny/small/medium/large) so the AI doesn’t “make stuff up” inconsistently.

Perfect — then we’ll do both, but not at the same time.
We’ll do them back-to-back in a controlled order, so nothing breaks and nothing gets sloppy.

Here’s the exact execution plan so you, Replit, and the agent are aligned.

⸻

✅ FINAL EXECUTION ORDER (LOCKED)

Wave 6A.1 — Nutrition (/meal-prep)

⬅️ First

Wave 6A.2 — Recovery (/recovery)

⬅️ Immediately after

Then we move to B (Polish/Stabilization), then C (Soft Complete + Wave 7).

⸻

🥗 WAVE 6A.1 — NUTRITION (GUIDED EXPERIENCE)

Goal

Bring Nutrition fully into the Wave 6.3 Guided Experience system so it feels equal to Meditation, Workouts, and Challenges.

Required Changes (No Deviation)

Page: /meal-prep

Layout (must use GuidedExperienceLayout)
	•	AI Picks (2–3 max, with Why)
	•	Category thumbnails
	•	Filters
	•	Single-select save pattern

Categories (thumbnails)

	•	Single-select enforcement
	•	Save persistence (Safari)
	•	Calendar confirmation
	•	No dead routes

⸻

🌿 WAVE 6A.2 — RECOVERY (NEW PAGE)

Goal

Create a dedicated Recovery space that is calm, embodied, and not buried inside Meditation.

Page
	•	Route: /recovery
	•	Must be linked from:
	•	Browse
	•	Hamburger menu
	•	AI suggestions

Layout

Use same GuidedExperienceLayout as other Wave 6.3 pages.

“What kind of recovery would help you today?”

Categories (thumbnails)
	•	Breathwork
	•	Stretch & Mobility
	•	Grounding
	•	Sleep Wind-Down
	•	Stress Reset

Filters
	•	Time (5 / 10 / 20)
	•	Style (Guided / Text)
	•	Intensity (Gentle / Moderate – optional)

Save Rules (same everywhere)
	•	Single-select
	•	Helper text
	•	Save to My System
	•	Optional Add to Calendar → confirmation
	•	Deep-link back to Recovery item

Acceptance Gate

Recovery must:
	•	Feel distinct from Meditation
	•	Have no fake buttons
	•	Save + calendar work on Safari
	•	Be fully navigable

⸻

📌 COPY/PASTE TO REPLIT (SHORT & CLEAR)

Proceed with Wave 6A in this order:

1) Update Nutrition (/meal-prep) to full Guided Experience layout
2) Create Recovery (/recovery) using the same layout and rules

Both must:
	•	Enforce single-select
	•	Disable Save until selection with helper text
	•	Persist saves after refresh
	•	Require confirmation before calendar adds
	•	Have no dead routes or “not available” pages

Provide updated PASS/FAIL and Safari recordings for Nutrition and Recovery when complete.

⸻

What happens after this (so you’re not wondering)

Once Nutrition + Recovery pass:
	•	Wave 6 = functionally complete
	•	We move into B: Polish/Stabilization
	•	Then C: Soft-complete Wave 6 + Wave 7 planning

No looping back. No redefining the philosophy again.

⸻

One last confirmation (yes/no)

When Nutrition is done, do you want:
	•	You to test Recovery first, or
	•	Replit/agent to implement Recovery immediately after Nutrition?

Just answer “Me” or “Them.”

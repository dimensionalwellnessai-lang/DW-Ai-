Got you. This is a stability + consistency + “nothing should be fake” moment. Before more features, you need a Major Checkpoint QA pass where Replit proves (with screenshots + route tests) that the app is functional end-to-end.

Below is exactly what to send Replit: a checkpoint checklist, required screenshots, and the specific bugs you listed translated into dev tasks with acceptance criteria.

Copy/paste to Replit: Major Checkpoint QA + Fix Pack

Major Checkpoint: App must be fully functional + consistent UI across all pages.
Please run a full QA checklist and fix these issues. I need proof with screenshots (not just “fixed”).

A) Non-negotiable Global Requirements (apply everywhere)
	1.	Every page must show:
	•	Hamburger menu
	•	Back button
	•	Home (AI Chat) access
✅ No exceptions (Daily Schedule, Browse, etc.)
	2.	No dead routes: no “Not available”, no blank screens.
	3.	All Save buttons must work consistently across the app.
	4.	Chat history: starting a chat with no prompt must still create a saved conversation thread.

Proof required: screenshot of header/nav controls on every page listed below.

⸻

B) Critical Bugs to Fix (with acceptance tests)

1) Meal Plans → Suggested Meals Save button not working
Fix: user must be able to select one option and save it to:
	•	Nutrition system (saved meals)
	•	AND optionally calendar with consent
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Select a suggested meal → tap Save → it appears in “Saved” AND (if chosen) adds to calendar.

2) Daily Schedule → Suggested Schedule opens “not available”
Fix: /daily-schedule Suggested Schedule must route to real Schedule Review page (or open the draft schedule modal).
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Tap Suggested Schedule → opens schedule review and shows the schedule, editable, savable.

3) Daily Schedule missing back button + hamburger menu
Fix: Add consistent navigation header.
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Daily schedule shows hamburger + back + home.

4) Meditation suggestions: Save button and Back button not working
Fix: Save must store selected meditation to “Saved” and optionally schedule. Back must navigate properly.
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Select a meditation → Save → shows under saved and/or appears in schedule if chosen.
	•	Back returns to previous page without breaking state.

5) Browse page: missing hamburger menu; needs consistent nav
Fix: Add hamburger menu to Browse.
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Browse has hamburger + back + home.

6) Challenges page: challenges not clickable / not actionable
Fix: Every challenge card must open a detail view and allow:
	•	View details
	•	Add to Plan
	•	Add to Calendar (with consent)
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Tap challenge → details open → add works → appears in plan/calendar.

⸻

C) “Major Checkpoint QA Checklist” (run + report results)

Please test every route and main CTA and confirm PASS/FAIL:

Navigation/Routes
	•	Home AI Chat
	•	Daily Schedule
	•	Calendar Week
	•	Calendar Month
	•	Workouts
	•	Meal Prep / Nutrition
	•	Meditation / Recovery
	•	Browse
	•	Challenges
	•	Plans
	•	Settings
	•	Feedback

Buttons must be tested on each relevant page
	•	Back button
	•	Hamburger menu open/close
	•	Save button
	•	Add to Calendar (with consent)
	•	Add to Plan (if present)

Deliverable: a table with PASS/FAIL + notes.

⸻

D) Screenshot Proof Required (must include UI header + page content)

Please provide screenshots for:
	1.	Daily Schedule (show hamburger + back + a schedule list)
	2.	Suggested Schedule Review page (show edit + save controls)
	3.	Meal Prep page with Suggested Meals + selection + Save result
	4.	Meditation page with suggestions + Save result
	5.	Browse page showing hamburger menu + filters
	6.	Challenge detail page showing “Add to Plan” + “Add to Calendar”
	7.	Calendar day where an added item appears
	8.	Plans screen showing a saved plan OR saved items

⸻

E) Browse page improvements (scope clarification)

I want Browse to be a category-specific search library (not random videos).
	•	Each category must have smart filters relevant to that category.
	•	Filters must control the results shown.
	•	Results should be relevant and consistent.

✅ Acceptance:
	•	Choosing Nutrition shows nutrition content + nutrition filters only.
	•	Choosing Recovery shows recovery content + recovery filters only.
	•	Filters clearly change what’s displayed.

⸻

F) Astrology accuracy note (scope)

Astrology should be based on the user’s chart/profile. If the user has many Cancer placements, the app should reflect that consistently (not random signs).
✅ Acceptance:
	•	Astrology screen references stored birth data or profile placements, not generic content.

⸻

What I recommend you do immediately (so this stops repeating)

Ask Replit to add two internal tools:
	1.	Route Audit page (/dev/routes)
Compares:

	•	route registry vs router
	•	menu links vs real routes
Flags missing routes.

	2.	Save/Action Harness
A simple internal test that clicks:

	•	Save / Add / Back
and logs whether state changed.

This prevents “fixed but not fixed”.

⸻

Quick clarity on “Browse should be search engine”

Just so we’re aligned: do you want Browse to:
	•	Pull content from YouTube only, or
	•	YouTube + articles, or
	•	Your own curated library (best quality)?

If you don’t answer, my default recommendation is:
YouTube + curated sources, with the AI summarizing inside the app (safer + cleaner than dumping random links).

If you want, paste your current public app link and tell me what device you’re testing on (iPhone Safari vs Chrome). Not to “stall” — it helps because the missing nav/back button issues often come from layout wrappers not being applied consistently on certain routes.

Perfect. Below is the complete, unified copy system for your app — labels, toasts, error states, and multi-select language — all aligned with your philosophy: calm, supportive, non-punitive, assistant-like.

You can hand this to Replit as the final UX language spec.

Offline / local fallback

Always start with Why:

📌 Copy/Paste Instruction to Replit (Final)

Use this exactly:

Apply the attached UX copy system globally.
Use single-select (“Pick one”) by default for suggestions, with Save disabled until one option is selected.
Multi-select must explicitly say “Select all that apply.”
Use “Save to My System” as the primary save label everywhere.
Replace all harsh or generic error messages with the calm error copy provided.
No page should say “not available.”
All Save actions must provide visible feedback (toast + Saved state).

⸻

Why this matters (big picture)

This does 4 critical things:
	1.	Removes decision anxiety
	2.	Fixes the Safari “faded Save” confusion permanently
	3.	Makes the app feel cohesive and intentional
	4.	Reinforces your identity: AI personal assistant, not a taskmaster

If you want next, I can:
	•	generate a QA checklist specifically for copy + state
	•	write voice-mode scripts using this same language
	•	or turn this into a 1-page product language spec PDF

Just say the word.

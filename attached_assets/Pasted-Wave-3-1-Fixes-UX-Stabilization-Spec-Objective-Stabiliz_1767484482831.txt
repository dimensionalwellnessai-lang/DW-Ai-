Wave 3.1 – Fixes & UX Stabilization Spec

Objective:
Stabilize the app so existing features work intuitively, progress is saved, navigation is consistent, and first-time users are guided properly. No major new features in this wave.

⸻

1. Calendar & Navigation
	•	Calendar items must be clickable and deep-link to their source (workout, meal, routine).
	•	Add edit capability for calendar events:
	•	change time
	•	add/remove recurrence
	•	Ensure every page has:
	•	back button OR
	•	home button OR
	•	hamburger menu (consistent)

⸻

2. State Persistence & Auth
	•	Save all in-progress data (body scan, chat, forms) even if user leaves the app.
	•	Persist login/session state reliably.
	•	On connection failure, show graceful recovery instead of blocking the app.

⸻

3. Tutorials (First-Time Users Only)
	•	Fix tutorial progression (Next must work).
	•	Add a tutorial to every page, shown only on first visit.
	•	Tutorials must:
	•	highlight UI elements
	•	allow interaction with highlighted buttons
	•	include Next / Skip
	•	Add a tutorial specifically for the hamburger menu explaining each item.

⸻

4. Inputs & Forms
	•	Allow multi-select where applicable (stress, emotions, etc.).
	•	When “create my own goals” is selected, show a free-text input.
	•	Add unit toggle (metric ↔ imperial) for height/weight.
	•	Clarify whether measurements are current stats or goals.

⸻

5. Body Scan & Camera
	•	Fix camera black-screen issue.
	•	Add option to upload photos from phone instead of live camera.
	•	Persist body scan progress so users don’t restart if they leave.

⸻

6. Search & AI Integration
	•	All search bars should invoke AI when empty or unclear.
	•	Ingredient substitution searches should return results or links inline.
	•	Keep results inside the page (not external navigation unless chosen).

⸻

7. Workouts & Media
	•	Add multiple “Add to” options:
	•	Today
	•	Routine
	•	Week
	•	Display YouTube thumbnails instead of raw links.

⸻

8. Menu & Ordering
	•	Move Journal above Meditation.
	•	Nest Today / Week / Month under Calendar as a dropdown.
	•	Ensure feedback form is accessible from inside the app.

⸻

Out of Scope for Wave 3.1 (Explicitly):
	•	Banking integrations
	•	Advanced financial analytics
	•	Scientific astrology content
	•	Large-scale document ingestion
	•	New AI memory systems

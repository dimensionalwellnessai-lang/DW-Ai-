SPEC: Starter Block Spotlight (Tone-Set) + One-Time DW Welcome Message

GOAL
Make the starter object created during Quick Setup impossible to miss.
When the user lands in DW Chat after setup, show a “Starter Block Spotlight” card at the top with your tone.
Also auto-send ONE welcome message from DW (only once) that reflects their setup.

NON-GOALS
- No refactors
- No new dependencies
- No backend
- No full notification system
- No rewriting navigation

TONE RULES (HARD)
- Calm, grounded, confident
- Minimal punctuation (avoid exclamation points)
- No therapy jargon, no cringe coaching
- “Flip the Switch” voice: direct, supportive, not fluffy

--------------------------------------------
1) REQUIRED DATA (use existing guest-storage)
--------------------------------------------
Use profileSetup fields already saved in guest-storage:
- scheduleType
- busiestDays[]
- wakeTime
- windDownTime
- focusArea  (body | food | mind | money | spirit | work)
- starterObjectId
- completedAt
- metDW (existing) OR add if missing

ADD ONE NEW FIELD:
- starterSpotlightDismissed: boolean (default false)

Rules:
- Spotlight shows only if starterObjectId exists AND starterSpotlightDismissed is false.
- DW welcome auto-message sends only if metDW is false.

--------------------------------------------
2) UX BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------------------

A) Spotlight card location
- Inside the DW Chat screen (the screen used by bottom nav “Dw chat”)
- Render at the top of the chat UI, above message list or pinned area.

B) Spotlight card content (tone-set)
Title:
- “Your first block is live.”

Subtitle (small/muted):
- “You’re officially not starting from zero.”

Body (by focusArea):
- body:  “I set up a simple movement block. Nothing extreme — just enough to get your body back online.”
- food:  “I added a starter food check so meals don’t turn into a last-minute scramble.”
- mind:  “I dropped in a short reset. Two minutes to slow things down and clear the noise.”
- money: “I added a quick money check-in. Awareness first — decisions come easier after.”
- spirit:“I set aside a small reflection moment. No pressure. Just space.”
- work:  “I created a focused work block so your energy has somewhere to go.”

Meta line (tiny/muted):
- “Created just now.”

Buttons:
Primary CTA:
- “Take me to it”
Secondary CTA:
- “I’ll come back later”

C) Spotlight button behaviors
- “I’ll come back later”
  - Set profileSetup.starterSpotlightDismissed = true
  - Save in guest-storage
  - Card disappears and stays gone across reloads

- “Take me to it”
  - Navigate user to the best screen to view the created object
  - If deep-linking by starterObjectId exists, use it
  - If not, route by focusArea:
    - body/work -> Calendar or Plan (where blocks/events are visible)
    - food/money -> Plan or Tasks list
    - mind/spirit -> Journal/Routines/Logs
  - OPTIONAL: after navigation, show a toast: “Here it is.”

D) One-time DW welcome message (auto-send)
- After Quick Setup completion, user is routed to DW Chat.
- On first arrival ONLY (metDW === false):
  - Auto-insert one message from DW that reflects the user setup.

Message template (tone-set):
“Alright. I’ve got a feel for your rhythm now.
You’re on a {scheduleType} flow, busiest on {busyDays}, and you want to start with {focusArea}.
I set something small up so you’re not starting from zero.
Want to look at what I made — or do you want help with tonight first?”

- After sending, set profileSetup.metDW = true and save.

--------------------------------------------
3) COPY LOCATION
--------------------------------------------
All strings should live in client/src/copy/en.ts if that file already stores copy.
Add a new object like:
- lifeSystem.starterSpotlight (title/subtitle/bodyByFocus/cta labels)
- dwChat.welcomeAfterSetup (template strings)

Do not hardcode visible strings in components.

--------------------------------------------
4) FILES TO CHANGE (MAX 3)
--------------------------------------------
1) client/src/lib/guest-storage.ts
   - Add starterSpotlightDismissed boolean in profileSetup
   - Ensure getter/setter functions support reading/writing it
   - Ensure metDW exists and persists

2) DW Chat screen component (the file used by bottom nav “Dw chat”)
   - Add Spotlight card rendering logic
   - Add one-time auto-message insertion on first arrival after setup
   - Implement CTA handlers (dismiss + navigate)

3) OPTIONAL (only if needed): client/src/pages/welcome.tsx
   - Ensure starterObjectId is definitely saved when created
   - Ensure metDW initializes false on setup completion (if not already)

--------------------------------------------
5) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (CLICK-BY-CLICK)
--------------------------------------------
1) Use your in-app Reset button
2) Complete Quick Setup and create starter object
3) App lands on DW Chat
4) Verify:
   - Spotlight card is visible at top
   - Copy matches tone
   - “Take me to it” routes correctly
   - “I’ll come back later” hides card
5) Reload app
   - Spotlight stays hidden if dismissed
   - DW welcome message does not duplicate
6) Reset again
   - Spotlight appears again (fresh run)

--------------------------------------------
6) OUTPUT REQUIRED FROM AGENT
--------------------------------------------
- Exact file paths changed
- Where metDW and starterSpotlightDismissed are stored and updated
- Where the spotlight routes for each focusArea
- How the auto-message is injected (and how duplicates are prevented)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE (IMPORTANT)
Do not guess the DW Chat route or component.
Search the codebase for the bottom nav label “Dw chat” and use the component that tab points to.
Do not add a new screen if one already exists.

Don’t approve yet. What they wrote is not enough proof — it’s a “dev narration,” not verification. You need them to prove Wave 6.3 works the same way we required in QA: Safari recordings + PASS/FAIL + no dead ends + correct single-select + consent dialogs everywhere.

Here’s exactly what to send back (copy/paste). It’s firm, simple, and keeps them on scope.

Copy/paste reply to Replit / Agent

Thanks — before I confirm “looks good,” I need Wave 6.3 QA proof (same standard as prior waves). Please provide:

1) iPhone Safari Screen Recordings (required)

Record in Safari (normal tab) and Safari (private tab):

Meditation
	•	Open Meditation guided experience
	•	Select 1 AI Pick → Save enables → Save works → shows “Saved”
	•	Add to Calendar → confirmation dialog appears → user confirms → event appears

Workouts
	•	Confirm single-select only (selecting a second option replaces the first)
	•	Save disabled until selection + helper text “Pick 1 option to save.”
	•	Add to Calendar must always require confirmation (no bypass)

Challenges
	•	AI Picks show “Why”
	•	Select 1 → Save works
	•	Add to Calendar → confirmation dialog → deep link works (event opens the linked page)

2) PASS/FAIL Table (required)

For each page (Meditation, Workouts, Challenges, Nutrition, Recovery):
	•	AI Picks present (2–3 max)
	•	“Why” present for each AI pick
	•	Categories/thumbnails visible
	•	Filters change results
	•	Cards clickable
	•	Single-select enforced
	•	Save disabled until selection + helper text shown
	•	Save persists after refresh
	•	Add to Calendar always uses confirmation dialog
	•	Calendar event deep-links back to item page

3) Scope Completion

You said you updated Meditation, Challenges, Workouts. Wave 6.3 also applies to:
	•	Nutrition
	•	Recovery

Please confirm those are implemented with the same shared layout + provide proof for them too.

4) No Regressions

Confirm:
	•	No dead routes
	•	No fake buttons
	•	Navigation consistency (hamburger/back/home) still present on these pages

5) Changed Files List

Provide the list of changed files / commits.

Once I have this proof and it passes in Safari, I’ll approve Wave 6.3.

What to look for when you test (super quick)

When you test it yourself, the two biggest “gotchas” are:
	•	Single-select: tapping a second card should replace the first selection (not add another).
	•	Calendar consent: every calendar add must show confirmation. No “silent add.”

If you want, paste the link to the build you’re testing and tell me which page you want to verify first (Meditation, Workouts, Challenges). I’ll give you a 60-second step list to test it on Safari so you can catch issues immediately.

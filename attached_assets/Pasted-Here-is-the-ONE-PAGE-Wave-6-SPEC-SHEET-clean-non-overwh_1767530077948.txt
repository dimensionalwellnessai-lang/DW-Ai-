Here is the ONE-PAGE Wave 6 SPEC SHEET — clean, non-overwhelming, and exactly what Replit needs to execute without interpretation.

You can copy & paste this whole thing.

⸻

🌊 WAVE 6 — ONE-PAGE SPEC (LOCKED)

GOAL

Turn the app into a calm, embodied personal assistant that adapts to the user’s energy and body state without forcing actions, diagnosing, or overwhelming them.

Wave 6 is assistant quality, not feature quantity.

⸻

BUILD ORDER (LOCKED)

Wave 6.1 → Wave 6.2 → Wave 6.3
	1.	Voice Mode (first)
	2.	Body & Energy Intelligence
	3.	Guided Experiences (Netflix-style)

Each phase must pass QA before the next begins.

⸻

WAVE 6.1 — VOICE MODE (PUSH-TO-TALK ONLY)

Scope
	•	Push-to-talk voice input
	•	Works in:
	•	AI Chat
	•	Meditation
	•	Talk It Out
	•	Voice mirrors UI (never acts alone)

Rules
	•	No auto-listening
	•	No wake words
	•	No auto-saving
	•	No forced navigation

Core Voice Copy (verbatim)
	•	“Hey. I’m here. What would you like to focus on today?”
	•	“That’s okay. We can take this one step at a time.”
	•	“I have an idea. Would you like to hear it?”
	•	“Got it. I’ve saved that for you.”

Voice must work reliably in iPhone Safari.

⸻

WAVE 6.2 — BODY & ENERGY INTELLIGENCE (ENHANCEMENT ONLY)

Use Existing Inputs Only
	•	Energy / mood / clarity sliders
	•	Existing body scan dialog
	•	User text input

❌ No new biometric sensors
❌ No nervous system detection labels

Required Enhancements
	•	Body scan is:
	•	Optional
	•	Resumable (no restart if app closes)

	•	Measurements separated clearly:
	•	Current state (“Where you are now”)
	•	Goal state (“What you’re working toward”)
	•	Units toggle:

AI Behavior

AI must:
	•	Adapt tone + suggestions based on energy
	•	Reduce suggestions when energy is low
	•	Offer, never restrict
	•	Always explain why it’s suggesting something

Example:

“I’m suggesting this because your energy is low today.”

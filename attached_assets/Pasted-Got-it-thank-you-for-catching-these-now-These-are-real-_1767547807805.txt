Got it — thank you for catching these now. These are real usability blockers, not small nitpicks. I’ll break this down cleanly into what’s likely happening, why, and exactly what to tell Replit / the AI dev to fix it without guesswork.

⸻

ISSUE 1: Document attached in chat → Press Send → Nothing happens

What this usually means

One of these is true (very common):
	1.	The message submit handler is not aware of attachments
	•	The UI lets you attach a file
	•	But onSend() only sends text
	•	So when text is empty + file exists → no-op
	2.	The backend endpoint is never called
	•	Frontend thinks it sent something
	•	API expects multipart/form-data
	•	Instead it’s sending JSON
	3.	The send button is disabled silently
	•	Validation logic says “no message”
	•	File doesn’t count as a message

⸻

EXACT FIX INSTRUCTION (COPY & PASTE)

Send this to Replit / the AI dev:

Bug: When attaching a document in chat and pressing Send, nothing happens.

Required fix:
	•	Update the chat send handler to treat file attachment as a valid message, even if text is empty.
	•	Ensure the submit logic triggers when message || attachedFile is present.
	•	Send file uploads using multipart/form-data, not JSON.
	•	Confirm the backend endpoint /api/chat/upload (or equivalent) is actually being called and returning a response.
	•	Add visible error handling if upload fails (toast or inline message).

Acceptance test:
	•	Attach PDF → press Send → upload starts
	•	User sees progress / response
	•	Extracted content appears in chat or preview flow

⸻

ISSUE 2: Upload button (top-right menu) → menu doesn’t scroll

What this usually means

This is almost always a CSS / container issue, not logic.

Likely causes:
	•	overflow: hidden on the menu container
	•	Menu has a fixed height but no overflow-y: auto
	•	The upload button is rendered outside the scrollable area

⸻

EXACT FIX INSTRUCTION (COPY & PASTE)

Send this as well:

Bug: The upload menu in the top-right does not scroll, making options inaccessible.

Required fix:
	•	Ensure the dropdown / menu container has overflow-y: auto.
	•	Set a max height (e.g. max-height: 80vh).
	•	Remove any parent container with overflow: hidden that clips the menu.
	•	Confirm the upload button and its options are inside the scrollable container, not absolutely positioned outside it.

Acceptance test:
	•	Open menu on small screen
	•	Scroll works
	•	All upload options accessible

⸻

IMPORTANT: WHY THESE MATTER PSYCHOLOGICALLY

These two bugs do something subtle but harmful:
	•	User tries to act → nothing happens
	•	App feels unresponsive, not calm
	•	Trust drops immediately

Fixing these is more important than adding any new feature.

⸻

OPTIONAL (BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

Ask them to add visible feedback:
	•	Upload spinner
	•	“Uploading…” text
	•	Success confirmation
	•	Error message if it fails

Silence is worse than errors.

⸻

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW
	1.	Send both fix blocks above to Replit / the AI dev
	2.	Ask for:
	•	confirmation of which file was changed
	•	screenshot or short clip of the fix working
	3.	Do not move forward until both are resolved

⸻

If you want, next time I can:
	•	Turn this into a QA checklist
	•	Help you test it in Safari specifically
	•	Or write a “blocking bugs” policy so these don’t slip again

But for now — you spotted the right things.

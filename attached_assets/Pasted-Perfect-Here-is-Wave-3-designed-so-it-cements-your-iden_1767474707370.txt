Perfect. Here is Wave 3, designed so it cements your identity as a true personal assistant and not “just another wellness app.”

I’m going to give you:
	1.	What Wave 3 is (in one sentence)
	2.	What Wave 3 builds (exact scope)
	3.	What Wave 3 explicitly does NOT build
	4.	The copy-paste spec to send to Replit
	5.	How to know Wave 3 is successful

Slow, intentional, high leverage.

🌊 WAVE 3 — DOCUMENT → SYSTEM INTELLIGENCE

1️⃣ Wave 3 in one sentence

Wave 3 allows users to upload a document and have the AI understand it, organize it, and place it into the right systems (calendar, workouts, nutrition, routines) — with review and consent.

This is the moment your app stops feeling like:

“an AI chat with features”

and starts feeling like:

“an assistant that actually handles my life systems.”

⸻

2️⃣ What Wave 3 BUILDS (exact scope)

🧠 Core Capability

Document Upload → AI Parsing → Preview → User Approval → Save

Supported file types:
	•	PDF
	•	DOCX
	•	Plain text

⸻

📥 Step-by-step User Flow

Step 1 — Upload
User clicks:

“Upload a plan or document”

Examples:
	•	meal plans
	•	workout programs
	•	routines
	•	schedules
	•	life plans
	•	PDFs like the one you shared

⸻

Step 2 — AI Analysis
UI shows:

“Analyzing your document…”

Behind the scenes, the AI:
	•	reads the full document
	•	detects structure
	•	identifies repeat patterns
	•	classifies content by system

⸻

Step 3 — Preview Screen (CRITICAL)
Before anything is saved, user sees a Preview with tabs:

Tabs:
	•	Summary
	•	Items Found
	•	Where They’ll Go

Each item shows:
	•	Title
	•	Category (Meal / Workout / Routine / Calendar / Pattern)
	•	Destination system
	•	Checkbox (include / exclude)

User can:
	•	rename items
	•	delete items
	•	change where items go

⸻

Step 4 — Save (Consent)
Button:

“Save to my system”

Nothing is written unless user confirms.

⸻

3️⃣ System Mapping Rules (this matters)

Nutrition System

AI detects:
	•	meals
	•	batch cooking steps
	•	portion rules
	•	weekly patterns

Creates:
	•	meal entries
	•	optional meal reminders (calendar)
	•	saved “plans”

⸻

Workout System

AI detects:
	•	workout days
	•	movement types
	•	durations
	•	rest days

Creates:
	•	workouts
	•	optional calendar blocks

⸻

Routines System

AI detects:
	•	step-by-step processes
	•	prep days
	•	repeatable flows

Creates:
	•	routines with checklist steps

⸻

Calendar System

AI detects:
	•	prep days
	•	recurring blocks
	•	suggested reminders

But:
	•	calendar items are always optional
	•	user must approve each suggestion

⸻

Patterns / Plans

AI groups everything into a named Plan, e.g.:

“4-Week Meal Prep System”

This plan can be:
	•	activated
	•	paused
	•	edited later

⸻

4️⃣ What Wave 3 DOES NOT BUILD (important discipline)

🚫 No auto-saving
🚫 No hidden scheduling
🚫 No background automation
🚫 No assumptions
🚫 No rewriting user content
🚫 No “optimization” without permission

The AI organizes, it does not control.

⸻

5️⃣ Copy-Paste Spec for Replit (Use This)

You can send this verbatim 👇

⸻

Wave 3 Build Spec — Document Upload & AI Organization

Objective:
Allow users to upload a document (PDF/DOCX/text). The AI scans the entire document, extracts structured items, and maps them into existing systems (Calendar, Workouts, Nutrition, Routines, Plans). User must review and approve before saving.

Key Requirements:
	•	Upload endpoint for PDF/DOCX/text
	•	Server-side text extraction
	•	AI parsing returns structured JSON:
	•	document_title
	•	sections
	•	meals[]
	•	workouts[]
	•	routines[]
	•	calendar_suggestions[]
	•	patterns/plans[]
	•	confidence score
	•	Preview UI with editable items and checkboxes
	•	Nothing saved without explicit confirmation
	•	Calm copy: “You can change anything before saving.”

UX Flow:
	1.	Upload document
	2.	“Analyzing your document…”
	3.	Preview with tabs (Summary / Items / Destinations)
	4.	User edits + confirms
	5.	Save to systems

Safety & Trust:
	•	Never auto-save
	•	Show exactly what will be created
	•	Allow skipping calendar suggestions
	•	If confidence is low, ask clarifying questions

⸻

6️⃣ How to know Wave 3 is successful

Wave 3 is a win if:
	•	Users say: “This saved me time”
	•	Users upload a second document
	•	Users trust the preview before saving
	•	No one is surprised by what gets added

If a user ever says:

“I didn’t realize it would add that”

→ Wave 3 failed and needs tightening.

⸻

7️⃣ Why Wave 3 is the right next move (founder lens)

Wave 3:
	•	differentiates you immediately
	•	supports calendar, workouts, and nutrition at once
	•	reduces manual input
	•	aligns perfectly with “AI personal assistant”
	•	sets you up for future monetization without rushing it

This is a real product leap, not feature fluff.

Next choices (pick one):
	1.	I write the exact JSON schema for document parsing
	2.	I simulate a full user journey using document upload
	3.	I help you scope Wave 4 (light memory + personalization)
	4.	I turn this into an investor roadmap narrative

Say the number.

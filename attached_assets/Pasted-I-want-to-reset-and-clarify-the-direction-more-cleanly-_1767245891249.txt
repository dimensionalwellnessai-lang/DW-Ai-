I want to reset and clarify the direction more cleanly.

The app should open directly into the AI assistant.
The assistant is the MAIN experience.
Everything else supports it.

This is an AI life coach + personal assistant.
It should feel calm, grounded, supportive, but not afraid to tell the truth.
No judgment, no shame, no “you’re doing life wrong” energy.

The assistant’s core role:
- Help users who struggle with decision-making
- Help users get unstuck
- Help users elevate their perspective
- Help users turn reflection into action (gently)

On first interaction, the AI should ask something simple like:
“What do you feel like you need today — or do you want help figuring that out?”

The AI should offer only a few options at a time, for example:
- Make a simple plan
- Talk things out
- Try a challenge
- I’m not sure, I need guidance

There should be a simple menu (three lines) in the top corner that opens supporting sections.
These sections should not overwhelm the user.

Core menu sections:

1) Challenges
Challenges are meant to empower and elevate users.
They help people push to the next level in a supportive way.

Challenge categories:
- Workout challenges
- Mental health challenges
- Meal / nutrition challenges
- Social challenges
- Financial challenges

Challenges should:
- Be optional
- Feel motivating, not punishing
- Help users build confidence and momentum
- Align with the user’s goals and lifestyle

2) Talk It Out
This is a dedicated AI mode where users can:
- Express feelings
- Vent frustrations
- Talk through life situations

In this mode, the AI should:
- Listen deeply
- Help shift perspective
- Gather understanding about the user’s values, goals, and non-negotiables
- Help the user build a personal blueprint for how they want to live

This mode should remain calm and supportive,
but it should not be afraid to offer honest, grounded insight when appropriate.

3) Calendar / Plans / Routines
These exist to support what comes out of conversation.
They should not feel like productivity tools on their own.

Important principles:
- Keep the interface simple
- Avoid overwhelming choices
- Let conversation guide structure
- Wellness should feel like support, not correction
- Users should always feel respected and empowered

For now:
- Focus on structure, flow, and tone
- Stub advanced features if needed
- Prioritize emotional clarity and ease of use

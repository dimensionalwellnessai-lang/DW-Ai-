Perfect. We’ll do both, in the right order, without adding chaos.

Below is a clean execution package you can immediately use.

⸻

✅ NEXT STEPS LOCKED

Order:
1️⃣ Run QA (Gatekeeper)
2️⃣ Lock Voice UI (So Wave 6 can start cleanly)

Nothing else moves until these are done.

⸻

1️⃣ RUN QA — FINAL GATE (WHAT YOU DO NOW)

What you send to Replit (copy/paste)

Use this exact message:

We are entering a QA gate before Wave 6 begins.

Please complete a full QA pass on iPhone Safari and fix all issues where:
	•	Save buttons are faded or non-functional
	•	Any route leads to “not available”
	•	Navigation (hamburger, back, home) is missing on any page
	•	Suggested Schedule does not open a real review/edit screen

Every page must have consistent navigation and working save flows.

I need the following before Wave 6 starts:
	1.	A PASS/FAIL checklist for every major page
	2.	Safari screen recordings proving Save + navigation works
	3.	A list of changed files

No Wave 6 features begin until this QA gate passes.

Pages that must PASS
	•	Home / AI Chat
	•	Daily Schedule
	•	Calendar (Day / Week / Month)
	•	Meal Prep (Suggested Meals Save works)
	•	Meditation (Suggested Save works)
	•	Browse (hamburger + filters work)
	•	Challenges (cards clickable + add works)
	•	Plans
	•	Settings / Feedback

If any fail → Wave 6 pauses.

⸻

2️⃣ LOCK VOICE UI — FINAL SPEC (NO GUESSING)

This prevents Replit from improvising voice UX.

⸻

🎙️ Voice UI Placement (Locked)

AI Chat
	•	Mic button: bottom-right
	•	Text input remains usable at all times

Meditation / Talk It Out
	•	Mic button: bottom-center
	•	Does NOT block navigation

⸻

🎛️ Mic States (Exact)

State	UI
Idle	Outline mic icon
Listening	Soft pulse ring (slow, subtle)
Processing	Small spinner
Error	Text fallback (no silent failure)

❌ No flashing
❌ No bouncing
❌ No auto-start

⸻

🧠 Voice Behavior Rules (Non-Negotiable)
	•	Push-to-talk only
	•	Never saves without confirmation
	•	Never navigates without permission
	•	Never interrupts the user
	•	Voice + UI always mirror each other

⸻

🗣️ Locked Voice Scripts (Verbatim)

Session start

“Hey. I’m here.
What would you like to focus on today?”

User unsure

“That’s okay.
We can take this one step at a time.”

Before suggesting

“I have an idea.
Would you like to hear it?”

After save

“Got it. I’ve saved that for you.”

Skip

“No problem.
We’ll adjust around it.”

Error

“That didn’t go through just yet.
We can try again or come back to it.”

⸻

✅ Voice Acceptance Criteria
	•	Works in iPhone Safari
	•	Can be stopped anytime
	•	App still usable without voice
	•	No dead states

Voice does not ship until QA passes.

⸻

🧭 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS

Once QA is green:
	•	Voice UI is implemented exactly as locked
	•	Then we move to Wave 6.2 (Body & Energy Intelligence)
	•	Then Wave 6.3 (Guided Experiences)

No rework. No backtracking.

⸻

One quick check from you (yes/no)

When Replit sends QA proof, do you want:
	•	You to review it first, or
	•	Me to help you review it line-by-line?

Just answer “Me” or “You” and we’ll proceed cleanly.

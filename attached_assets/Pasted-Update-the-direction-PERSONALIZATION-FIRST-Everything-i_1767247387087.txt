Update the direction:

PERSONALIZATION FIRST:
Everything in the app should be driven by the user’s profile/preferences.
The AI should behave like ChatGPT: it asks questions when needed, remembers answers, and uses them to personalize recommendations.

The app experience is a blend of:
- ChatGPT-style AI assistant (conversation-first, smart questions, memory)
- Meditation app (Breathe/Calm-like browsing: thumbnails, moods, durations, intentions)
- Workout/bodybuilding planner (personalized routines, plans, progression)

KEY BEHAVIOR:
- The app should NOT be pre-populated with random content that ignores the user.
- Instead, the assistant builds the user profile quickly through conversation (micro-onboarding).
- Content shown in Browse (meditation/workouts/meals/challenges) should be personalized based on profile + recent mood + goals.

PROFILE (store this and keep updating):
- goals (choose 1–3)
- schedule availability
- diet restrictions + allergies
- workout preference (home/gym, equipment)
- fitness goal (muscle gain, fat loss, maintenance, performance)
- experience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- injuries/limitations (optional)
- preferred coaching tone (gentle / steady / direct)
- preferred meditation style (guided vs instructions-only, voice style, duration range)
- reminder preference

AI QUESTION STYLE:
- Ask only what’s needed, when it’s needed (like ChatGPT).
- Do not overwhelm users with long forms.
- If the user is stuck, offer 2–4 options and guide them calmly.

HOME / MAIN SCREEN:
- Main screen opens to AI chat with minimal UI:
  “How can I help you today?”
- Offer quick actions:
  Make a plan / Talk it out / Start a challenge / Browse
- No long paragraphs on Home.

BROWSE (NETFLIX STYLE, BUT PERSONALIZED):
- Show rows/grids with thumbnails
- Use filters: mood, goal, duration, difficulty, equipment, diet
- Content should be ranked and displayed based on the user profile.
- If profile info is missing, the assistant asks short questions and then updates the browse results.

CHALLENGES:
Add a Challenges section (personalized):
- Workout challenges
- Mental health challenges
- Meal challenges
- Social challenges
- Financial challenges
Each challenge has a start button that creates daily tasks + optional calendar blocks.

TALK IT OUT MODE:
Add a Talk it out mode in the assistant:
- Supportive, calm, but can give honest grounded truth without shaming.
- Ends with 1 suggested next step (task/routine).

CALENDAR:
Use a real calendar with month view (dates/numbers/year) + day agenda.

BLUEPRINT:
Blueprint screen for the 8 dimensions of wellness.
Each dimension shows a synopsis based on the user profile + behavior.
If the assistant needs more info, show “Answer 3 questions” to refine that dimension.

BODY SCAN FEATURE (IMPORTANT):
Add a Body Scan feature that uses the device camera (with explicit consent).
Phase 1 (MVP):
- Capture front/side photos or short video
- Ask user goals + optional measurements (height/weight/waist)
- Store only if the user agrees (or process without saving)
- Use results to personalize workout/meal recommendations (no medical claims)

Phase 2 (advanced):
- Optional computer-vision based estimates (only if feasible)
- Must include privacy notice, consent, and ability to delete images/data

PRIVACY & SAFETY:
- Clear consent before camera use
- “Delete my data” option
- No medical diagnosis or guarantees
- Keep it supportive and empowering

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1) Fix UI flow: AI-first + simple nav + real calendar
2) Build user profile + ChatGPT-like question behavior
3) Personalize browse based on profile
4) Add body scan Phase 1
Leave deeper AI and advanced vision as Phase 2.

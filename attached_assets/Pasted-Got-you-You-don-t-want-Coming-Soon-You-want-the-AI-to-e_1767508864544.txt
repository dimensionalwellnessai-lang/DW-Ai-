Got you. You don’t want “Coming Soon.” You want the AI to enforce that every button leads to a working experience, even if it has to generate a new page/flow on the spot. And specifically: Suggested Schedule must be viewable → editable → savable into your Life System.

Here’s the process + logic to make that true, plus a copy/paste spec for Replit.

⸻

The rule: “No Dead Ends”

Every route + button must do one of these:
	1.	Open a real tool page (Calendar / Tasks / Routines / Workouts / Nutrition / Journal)
	2.	Open a “generator flow” that creates the content (AI generates → you edit → you save)
	3.	Open a working settings/info screen

Never: blank page, “not built,” dead route, nothing happening.

⸻

System Process (how the app guarantees this)

1) Route Registry (single source of truth)

Create a single list that defines every route and what it does:
	•	id
	•	path
	•	label
	•	icon
	•	type = page | generator | modal
	•	handler = what happens when opened
	•	requiredData = what must exist
	•	fallbackHandler = what to do if required data is missing

Result: the app can validate itself.

⸻

2) Navigation Guard (prevents dead routes)

Any time a user clicks a button/link:

Guard logic
	•	If route exists → open it
	•	If route missing → create the page automatically using a standard template (same layout + back + save)
	•	If route exists but feature data missing → route opens anyway and triggers generator flow (“Let’s set this up”)

So users never hit a wall.

⸻

3) “Functional Minimum Page Template”

When a page is created (or missing parts), it must still be functional with:
	•	Title + description
	•	One main action
	•	Save/Cancel
	•	AI help button
	•	Back/Home/Hamburger available

This is what keeps everything “real” even before you add fancy content.

⸻

The specific feature you asked for: Suggested Schedule must be real

✅ Suggested Schedule: Required behavior

When the AI generates a schedule, the user must be able to:

A) Click “Suggested Schedule”

Opens Schedule Review screen (not chat)

B) See it in a real timeline
	•	Day view and week view
	•	Blocks show: title, time, category, notes
	•	Expand block for details

C) Edit it
	•	Drag/drop time (mobile friendly)
	•	Change duration
	•	Change category (work/wellness/etc.)
	•	Add notes
	•	Delete block
	•	Add new block

D) Save it into “Life System”

When they tap Save, the schedule becomes:
	•	Calendar events (or routines + calendar events depending on type)
	•	Stored as a “Plan Version”:
	•	name: “Week Plan — Jan 6”
	•	source: “AI Suggested”
	•	status: Draft → Active when user confirms

E) Consent step (legal safety)

Before writing to calendar:
	•	“This will add X blocks to your calendar. Proceed?”
	•	Buttons: Add / Edit / Cancel

⸻

What “Save to Life System” means (data model)

Minimum models:

Plan
	•	id
	•	name
	•	startDate / endDate
	•	createdFrom (AI/manual/import)
	•	status (draft/active/archived)

PlanItem
	•	planId
	•	type (event/routine/task)
	•	title
	•	startTime/endTime
	•	category
	•	linkedRoute (optional deep link)
	•	notes
	•	sourceConfidence (optional)

So now “Suggested Schedule” is a real object, not chat text.

⸻

Copy/paste spec for Replit (what to tell them)

Use this:

Goal: Zero dead-end pages. No “not built” routes. Every button must be functional.

1) Implement a Route Registry + Navigation Guard
	•	Create a single registry listing every route/button in the app (id/path/label/icon/type/handler/fallback).
	•	On click/navigation, validate route exists. If missing, auto-create a functional page using a standard page template.
	•	If route exists but required data is missing, page should still load and trigger an AI setup flow (not block user).

2) Implement Suggested Schedule as a real editable tool
	•	Clicking “Suggested Schedule” must open a Schedule Review page (not just chat).
	•	Show schedule in a timeline (day/week).
	•	Allow edits: change time/duration/category/notes, delete/add blocks.
	•	Add “Save to Life System” which creates a Plan + PlanItems and then (with consent) commits to calendar.
	•	Store saved schedules as plan versions (Draft/Active) so user can revisit and modify later.

Acceptance Tests
	•	Tap every menu item and every home button: no blank screens, no “page not built.”
	•	Suggested Schedule: open → view → edit → save → appears in calendar + retrievable under Plans/Life System.
	•	If user cancels consent, nothing is written to calendar, but plan can remain as Draft.

Quick decision I’ll make for you (so we don’t stall)

To keep it simple and not “turn into just a scheduling app”:
	•	The app becomes a life system
	•	The calendar is the “display layer”
	•	The “Life System” is the “source layer” (plans, routines, tasks)
	•	The AI is the “builder layer”

That’s clean.

⸻

If you want, I can also write the exact UI flow screens (names + buttons) so Replit can build it fast:
	•	Home (AI Chat)
	•	Plans (Life System)
	•	Schedule Review (AI Suggested)
	•	Plan Editor
	•	Commit Confirmation
	•	Calendar View (Day/Week/Month)

Just say: “Yes, write the UI screens.”

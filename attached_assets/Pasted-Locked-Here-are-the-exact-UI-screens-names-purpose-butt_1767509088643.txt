Locked. Here are the exact UI screens (names, purpose, buttons, and what happens) so Replit can build it fast and consistently — with zero dead ends and a real Suggested Schedule → Edit → Save to Life System flow.

Global Rules (apply to every screen)

Copy/paste instruction to Replit

Here’s the message you can paste:

Please implement the UI screens and flows exactly as specified: Home AI Chat as main screen, hamburger menu with Calendar dropdown and App Tour above auth, Life System Plans screen, Suggested Schedule Review page (view/edit/save), Block Details editor, Plan Builder wizard that outputs draft schedules, and enforce “No Dead Ends” by ensuring every button routes to a working page or generator flow. Add deep links from calendar events to source pages and add a /dev/routes route audit tool to ensure no broken routes.

⸻

If you want, I can also write the route map table (Route → Component → Purpose → Buttons → Next Routes) so it’s basically plug-and-play for their router.

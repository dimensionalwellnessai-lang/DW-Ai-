Cool — then we’ll do ALL THREE (A + B + C) in one clean spec you can paste into Replit.

Below is a single, implementation-ready blueprint:
	•	A) UI flow + screens
	•	B) Onboarding / intake questions + branching + scoring
	•	C) AI rules for recommendations, plan generation, and status updates

⸻

FLIP THE SWITCH — IMPLEMENTATION SPEC (PHASE 1–3 CORE BUILD)

	•	History: weekly summary, switch status timeline
	•	Reset options: restart onboarding, clear plan, export later

⸻

Loading / Error / Empty Rules (global)
	•	Loading: never blank—show skeleton cards
	•	Error: “Something didn’t load. Try again.” + Retry
	•	Empty: always explain what to do next with 1 CTA

⸻

B) INTAKE / ONBOARDING (QUESTIONS + BRANCHING + PRIORITY SCORING)

Onboarding Goals
	•	Explain “Switchboard + Perspective Training”
	•	Identify user’s top 1–2 priority switches
	•	Capture constraints: time, energy, schedule reality
	•	Output: “Start recommendation” + first plan

⸻

Onboarding Script (Short + Clear)

Screen 1: Welcome
	•	“Flip the Switch is a life system.”
	•	“Each dimension is a switch.”
	•	“We’ll find your top switches in 2 minutes.”
	•	CTA: Let’s do it

⸻

Intake Questions (with answer formats + scoring)

Q1: “Right now, what feels MOST true?”

(choose up to 2)
	•	A) “I’m tired / drained.” → Body +2, Mind +1
	•	B) “I’m overwhelmed / mentally noisy.” → Mind +2, Time +1
	•	C) “I don’t know what to do next.” → Purpose +2, Time +1
	•	D) “Money stress is heavy.” → Money +2, Mind +1
	•	E) “People are draining me / I feel alone.” → Relationships +2, Mind +1
	•	F) “My space / environment is a mess.” → Environment +2, Time +1
	•	G) “I keep starting over / inconsistent.” → Identity +2, Time +1
	•	H) “Everything is okay, I just want to level up.” → Purpose +1, Identity +1, Body +1

Q2: “How much time can you realistically give most days?”

(single choice)
	•	10 min → Time constraint tag: TINY
	•	20–30 min → SMALL
	•	45–60 min → MEDIUM
	•	90+ min → LARGE

Q3: “Your energy lately is…”

(single choice)
	•	Low → Mode bias: Restoring
	•	Medium → Mode bias: Training (light)
	•	High → Mode bias: Training (moderate)

Q4: “Which area do you avoid the most?”

(single choice)
	•	Moving my body → Body +2
	•	Facing emotions/thoughts → Mind +2
	•	Planning my day → Time +2
	•	Thinking about future → Purpose +2
	•	Looking at finances → Money +2
	•	Having hard conversations → Relationships +2

Q5: “What would make the biggest difference THIS WEEK?”

(choose 1)
	•	More energy → Body +2
	•	Less stress → Mind +2
	•	More structure → Time +2
	•	Direction/motivation → Purpose +2
	•	Feeling stable → Money +2 or Environment +2 (if they chose mess earlier)
	•	Better relationships → Relationships +2
	•	Feeling like myself again → Identity +2

Q6 (Optional): “Anything you want to prioritize?”

(free text)
	•	Stored as user goals, used for plan personalization.

⸻

Priority Switch Selection Logic
	1.	Total points per switch from Q1/Q4/Q5
	2.	Sort descending
	3.	Pick Top 1 as “Primary Switch”
	4.	Pick Top 2 as “Support Switch” if within 2 points of top (or if user selected 2 in Q1)

⸻

Onboarding Output Copy (must be consistent)
	•	“Your system right now is most affected by: [Primary Switch].”
	•	“Support switch: [Support Switch].”
	•	“Mode for today: [Restoring/Training/Maintaining] based on energy + time.”

CTA:
	•	Generate my first plan

⸻

C) AI RULES (RECOMMENDATIONS + PLAN GEN + STATUS UPDATES)

Core AI Principle

Never give the user 10 options.
Always give:
	•	1 recommendation
	•	1 alternative
	•	1 reason

⸻

Recommendation Engine Rules

Inputs
	•	Primary switch
	•	Support switch
	•	Last 7 days completion (done/skip)
	•	Energy level (user selected or inferred from check-ins)
	•	Time available (TINY/SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
	•	Stress indicator (from Mind check-ins)

Output
	•	recommended switch
	•	mode (Training/Maintaining/Restoring)
	•	1 action now
	•	2–4 actions for plan

Rule Set
	1.	If energy = Low → Restoring mode; prioritize Body or Mind
	2.	If completion rate < 30% over 7 days → shrink plan (TINY/SMALL) + Restoring
	3.	If user reports “overwhelmed” → prioritize Time switch with 10–20 min structure reset
	4.	If money stress flagged 2+ times → suggest Money switch (tiny action: check balance/bills list)
	5.	If relationships drain flagged → suggest Relationships (boundary script / one repair action)
	6.	If environment flagged + time chaos flagged → suggest Environment first (15-min reset) THEN Time
	7.	If everything stable + user wants level up → Purpose or Identity Training (moderate)

⸻

Plan Generation Template (always the same structure)

Plan Header
	•	“Switch: [X]”
	•	“Mode: [Restoring/Training/Maintaining]”
	•	“Time: [10/20/45 mins]”
	•	“Intensity: [Light/Moderate/Deep]”
	•	“Why this matters (1–2 lines)”

The Plan (2–4 actions max)
	1.	Action Now (today)

	•	must be doable in the chosen time
	•	must not require extra research unless Browse exists

	2.	Repeatable Routine Block (this week)

	•	2–4 times per week or daily micro-version

	3.	One Support Switch Action

	•	tiny action that supports primary switch

	4.	Check-in Question

	•	“What changed after doing this?”

Plan must end with:
	•	“Want to keep it light or go deeper?” (2 buttons)

⸻

Switch Status Update Rules

When to update status
	•	After 2 completed actions for a switch in 7 days → Off → Flickering
	•	After 5 completed actions in 14 days → Flickering → Stable
	•	After 10 completed actions in 21 days + positive check-ins → Stable → Powered

Regression (no shame)
	•	If 14 days no activity → Powered/Stable can drop one level (Powered → Stable; Stable → Flickering)
	•	Copy: “This switch cooled down — totally normal. Let’s restart light.”

⸻

Check-in System (simple, fast)

After any completed action, ask ONE:
	•	“Did this help?” (Yes/Some/No)

If “No” twice in a row:
	•	reduce intensity
	•	switch mode to Restoring
	•	offer alternative action

⸻

Voice/Tone Rules (Flip the Switch personality)
	•	Never guilt.
	•	No corporate therapy talk.
	•	Short, confident lines.
	•	Always explain “why” in 1 sentence.

Examples:
	•	“We’re not fixing your whole life today. We’re powering one switch.”
	•	“Small is powerful when it’s consistent.”
	•	“Energy first. Then everything else.”

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (DON’T SKIP)
	1.	Build Switchboard UI + cards + states (Phase 1)
	2.	Build Onboarding + scoring + output (Phase 2)
	3.	Build Switch Detail → Generate Plan → Save to Plan (Phase 3)
	4.	Add Tracking + Weekly reflection (Phase 4)
	5.	Add Recommendation engine hooks (Phase 5)
	6.	Add Phase 2 unlock later (Phase 6)
	7.	Add Browse/Learning later (Phase 8)

⸻

If you want the next thing to paste into Replit, tell me which format you prefer:

1) JSON blueprint schema (so the AI can implement data structures clean)
2) UI copy pack (every button, title, empty state, microcopy)
3) Dev tickets (GitHub-style tasks with acceptance criteria)

Say 1, 2, or 3.

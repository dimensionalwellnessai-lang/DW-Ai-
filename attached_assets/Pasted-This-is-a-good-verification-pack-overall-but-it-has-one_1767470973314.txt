This is a good verification pack overall — but it has one major missing piece you should not accept as “verified” yet:

🚩 The pack is not “verification” without evidence

They listed routes and described what you’ll see, but they did not provide screenshots/video, so it’s still a claim, not proof.

That’s normal (some builders can’t screenshot easily), but you should respond with a “prove it” test protocol and a tight acceptance checklist.

Below is exactly what to do next.

⸻

1) Your decision on their pack (what’s solid vs what’s weak)

✅ Solid
	•	Clear routes for each feature:
/daily-schedule, /calendar, /workout, /meal-prep
	•	Consent flow described with explicit functions (good sign)
	•	They identified what existed vs what they changed (very helpful)
	•	Stability checks (LSP errors, routes registered) is the right category of check

⚠️ Weak / Missing
	•	No screenshots, no video, no commit link/diff
	•	“No 404s” is not the same as “no runtime errors”
	•	No proof that consent flow works on every entry point (filter + AI flow + card add)

So: this is “probably built,” but not confirmed.

⸻

2) What YOU should do right now (10-minute verification)

Open your app and test in this exact order:

Test A — Calendar Today

Go to: /daily-schedule
	•	Do you see a list of today items?
	•	Is it readable without confusion?

Test B — Week view

Go to: /calendar
	•	Can you switch days?
	•	Does it show events per day?

Test C — Workouts

Go to: /workout
	•	Do you see Pick my workout button?
	•	Do filters toggle (Time/Goal/Equipment)?
	•	Click Add to Today on a workout card:
	•	Does a dialog pop up?
	•	Can you click Not Now and confirm nothing gets added?
	•	Can you click Add to Today and confirm it appears in /daily-schedule?

Test D — Meal Prep

Go to: /meal-prep
	•	Do you see Suggest meals for today?
	•	Run it once — do suggestions appear?
	•	Click add:
	•	Confirm dialog appears
	•	Not Now = no event
	•	Add to Today = shows in /daily-schedule

Test E — “Consent everywhere”

Try at least 2 different add paths in each page:
	•	Add from AI dialog
	•	Add from a card/list item

If any path saves without confirmation → fail.

⸻

3) What to send back to Replit (tight response)

Copy/paste this:

Thanks — this is helpful. I still need evidence-based verification before I accept Wave 2 as complete.

Please provide one of the following:
A) a short screen recording (2–3 minutes) showing:
	•	/workout: Pick my workout → Add to Today → consent dialog → event appears in /daily-schedule
	•	/meal-prep: Suggest meals → Add to Today → consent dialog → event appears in /daily-schedule
	•	/calendar and /daily-schedule views

OR
B) screenshots of those exact screens (same items)

Also confirm: Not Now never creates an event, and this is true for every add button (AI + cards).

Once I confirm those, I’ll approve Wave 2 and we’ll define Wave 3 scope.

This keeps you in control without being confrontational.

⸻

4) Whether you should approve Wave 2 right now

✅ Approve Wave 2 only if you personally confirm:
	•	Both workout and meal flows add to calendar only after dialog confirmation
	•	Items show in /daily-schedule after adding
	•	No crashes / blank pages

If those pass → yes, Wave 2 is real progress.

⸻

5) What’s next after you approve (Wave 3 options)

Once Wave 2 is verified, Wave 3 should be one of these (not all):

Option 1 — Month Calendar grid (visual upgrade)
	•	full month view
	•	drag/drop later
	•	still consent-based adds

Option 2 — Document upload → AI organizes (your big vision)
	•	upload PDF
	•	extract meals/workouts/routines
	•	preview + approve mapping
	•	save to systems

Option 3 — Personalization engine (light memory)
	•	store preferences: energy patterns, time availability, diet restrictions
	•	improves suggestions without heavy onboarding

My recommendation: Wave 3 = Document Upload + Organize, because it supports your “personal assistant” identity best.

⸻

If you want, tell me what happened when you ran Tests A–E (even just: pass/fail per test), and I’ll tell you exactly whether to approve Wave 2 or request fixes, and what the next sprint should be.

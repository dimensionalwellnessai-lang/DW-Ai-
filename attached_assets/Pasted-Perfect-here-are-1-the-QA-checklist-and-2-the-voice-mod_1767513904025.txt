Perfect — here are (1) the QA checklist and (2) the voice-mode scripts, written so they’re practical, testable, and aligned with your philosophy. You can hand both straight to Replit.

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ MAJOR QA CHECKLIST (COPY + STATE + FLOW)

This checklist is specifically designed to catch the issues you’re seeing (Safari, faded buttons, dead routes, inconsistency).

A. Global UI & Navigation (ALL PAGES)

Test every page listed below.

Must be present on every page:
	•	Hamburger menu ✅
	•	Back button (works) ✅
	•	Home / AI Chat access ✅
	•	Page title visible ✅

Acceptance test
	•	Open page → open hamburger → navigate elsewhere → come back → state preserved

Pages to test:
	•	Home / AI Chat
	•	Daily Schedule
	•	Calendar (Day / Week / Month)
	•	Meal Prep
	•	Meditation / Recovery
	•	Workouts
	•	Browse
	•	Challenges
	•	Plans
	•	Settings
	•	Feedback

⸻

B. Save Button Logic (CRITICAL)

For every screen with Save to My System:

Before selection
	•	Button is faded/disabled
	•	Helper text shows: “Pick 1 option to save.”

After selection
	•	Option highlights clearly
	•	Button becomes enabled immediately
	•	Button tap works in Safari

After save
	•	Toast appears: “Saved.”
	•	Button changes to “Saved” OR card shows Selected / Saved
	•	Refresh page → saved item still exists

Acceptance test
	•	No Save button ever does “nothing”
	•	No Save button enabled without a selection

⸻

C. Suggested Schedule Flow

From Daily Schedule:
	1.	Tap Suggested Schedule
	2.	System must:
	•	Open a real Schedule Review screen (never “not available”)
	•	OR create a draft automatically and open it
	3.	On review screen:
	•	Buttons visible:
	•	Save to My System
	•	Add to Calendar
	•	Edit Schedule
	•	Back

Acceptance test
	•	Suggested Schedule always opens something editable
	•	User can save OR exit without losing app state

⸻

D. Chat History Persistence

Test this exact scenario:
	1.	Open app
	2.	Do not type anything
	3.	Navigate away
	4.	Come back
	5.	Start chatting

Acceptance test
	•	That conversation appears in history
	•	No “ghost” or missing chats

⸻

E. Browse Page Functionality

For each category (Nutrition, Recovery, Workouts, etc.):
	•	Hamburger menu present
	•	Search works within the category
	•	Filters are relevant to the category
	•	Results change when filters change

Acceptance test
	•	Browse behaves like a category-specific search engine, not a static list

⸻

F. Challenges Page

For every challenge card:
	•	Card is clickable
	•	Opens challenge detail view
	•	Buttons work:
	•	Add to My Plan
	•	Add to Calendar
	•	View Details

Acceptance test
	•	Challenge can be added and appears in Plan or Calendar

⸻

G. Safari-Specific Tests (Non-negotiable)

All of the above must pass in:
	•	iPhone Safari (normal tab)
	•	iPhone Safari (Private tab)

Proof required
	•	Screen recordings (not just screenshots)
	•	PASS / FAIL table
	•	List of changed files

⸻

🎙️ 2️⃣ VOICE-MODE SCRIPTS (ASSISTANT TONE)

These scripts define how the AI speaks when voice is enabled. Calm, human, supportive — never robotic.

⸻

A. Voice Session Start

“Hey. I’m here.
What would you like to focus on today?”

(Then show buttons visually if screen is on.)

⸻

B. When User Sounds Unsure

“That’s okay — we don’t have to decide everything at once.
We can take this one step at a time.”

⸻

C. When Suggesting Something

“I have an idea.
Would you like to hear it?”

(Only continue if user says yes.)

⸻

D. Explaining a Suggestion

“I suggested this because it supports your goal without adding pressure.
You can take it, change it, or skip it.”

⸻

E. Save Confirmation (Voice)

“Got it. I’ve saved that for you.”

⸻

F. When User Skips Something

“No problem. We’ll adjust around it.”

(No follow-up guilt.)

⸻

G. When Energy Is Low

“Let’s keep this light today.
Even small steps count.”

⸻

H. When Energy Is High

“You’ve got good energy right now.
Want to use it, or save it for later?”

⸻

I. When There’s an Error

“That didn’t go through just yet.
You can try again, or we can come back to it later.”

⸻

J. Voice Exit

“I’ll be right here when you’re ready.”

⸻

🧾 Copy/Paste Instruction to Replit (Final)

Use this exactly:

Complete the attached QA checklist across all pages, with special attention to Safari behavior.
Fix any Save button that remains disabled after selection.
No route may lead to a “not available” page.
Provide screen recordings and a PASS/FAIL table.

Implement the provided voice-mode scripts verbatim for assistant interactions to ensure consistent tone.

⸻

Big picture (why this matters)

This locks in:
	•	Trust (nothing feels fake)
	•	Consistency (no cognitive friction)
	•	Emotional safety
	•	Assistant-level polish

You’re no longer “building features” — you’re hardening the experience.

If you want next, I can:
	•	convert this QA checklist into a test case spreadsheet
	•	design voice + visual hybrid flows
	•	or help you decide when Wave 6 is allowed to start

Just tell me.

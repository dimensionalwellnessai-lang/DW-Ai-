Perfect choice. Option 2 (Calm & Thorough) is exactly aligned with the kind of product you’re building and the philosophy you’ve been protecting this whole time.

Below is the official Phase B plan, written so you can:
	•	understand it clearly,
	•	keep control of scope,
	•	and hand it directly to Replit without confusion or feature creep.

⸻

🧼 PHASE B — POLISH & STABILIZATION

Duration: 1–2 weeks
Goal: Make the app feel finished, calm, predictable, and trustworthy

This phase is about experience integrity, not expansion.

⸻

🎯 PHASE B SUCCESS CRITERIA (WHAT “DONE” MEANS)

When Phase B is complete:
	•	A first-time user never feels lost
	•	A returning user never loses progress
	•	Nothing important silently fails
	•	The app behaves the same across pages
	•	The AI feels supportive, not intrusive
	•	The system feels theirs, not imposed

⸻

🔧 PHASE B WORKSTREAMS (LOCKED SCOPE)

1️⃣ Navigation Consistency (ALL PAGES)

Requirement
	•	Every page must have:
	•	Hamburger menu OR
	•	Back button OR
	•	Both
	•	Home / AI chat must always be reachable

Fixes include
	•	Missing hamburger on Browse, Finance, Astrology, etc.
	•	Broken back buttons
	•	Dead-end routes

✅ PASS condition:
User can always get back without thinking.

⸻

2️⃣ Save Reliability (GLOBAL)

Applies to
	•	Meal Plans
	•	Meditation
	•	Recovery
	•	Challenges
	•	Suggested Schedules
	•	Any “Save” or “Add” action

Rules
	•	Save must actually persist
	•	Clear success feedback (“Saved”)
	•	Save disabled until valid selection
	•	Refresh never wipes saved state
	•	Safari backgrounding does not lose state

🚫 No silent failures. Ever.

⸻

3️⃣ Tutorials / App Tour (First-Time UX)

Rules
	•	Tutorials:
	•	Highlight visible UI elements (no invisible blur-only states)
	•	Allow interaction with highlighted buttons
	•	Allow Next / Skip
	•	Never trap user
	•	Tutorials run once only
	•	“How to Use / App Tour” button:
	•	Lives just above Sign In / Account
	•	Manually re-launchable

✅ PASS condition:
User understands the app in under 60 seconds.

⸻

4️⃣ Auth State Stability (CRITICAL)

Requirements
	•	Login persists across:
	•	refresh
	•	Safari background
	•	tab switching
	•	Hamburger menu reflects auth state instantly:
	•	“Sign In / Sign Up” → “Account / Log out”
	•	Logout clears state cleanly

🚫 No more “I logged in but UI doesn’t know.”

⸻

5️⃣ Calendar UX (Editability & Trust)

Calendar events must
	•	Be editable
	•	Be reschedulable
	•	Allow stopping recurrence
	•	Allow time changes
	•	Be deletable
	•	Be AI-editable only on request

Export
	•	Calendar export must work cleanly
	•	No duplicate events

⸻

6️⃣ Browse Page Consistency

Browse = search engine for that dimension

Requirements
	•	Filters actually affect results
	•	AI Picks visible and consistent
	•	Thumbnails instead of raw links
	•	YouTube stays embedded unless user taps “Open”

⸻

🧠 WHAT IS EXPLICITLY NOT INCLUDED (IMPORTANT)

🚫 No new features
🚫 No monetization
🚫 No community/social
🚫 No wearables
🚫 No analytics dashboards

Those belong to Wave 7+.

⸻

📌 COPY/PASTE TO REPLIT (OFFICIAL PHASE B KICKOFF)

Wave 6A is approved.
We are entering Phase B: Calm & Thorough Polish (1–2 weeks).

Scope is strictly limited to:
	•	Navigation consistency
	•	Save reliability
	•	Tutorial correctness
	•	Auth state persistence
	•	Calendar edit UX
	•	Browse/filter consistency

No new features or pages.
Please break Phase B into checkpoints with PASS/FAIL and Safari verification.

⸻

🧭 YOUR ROLE DURING PHASE B (VERY LIGHT)

You only need to:
	•	sanity-check “does this feel calm?”
	•	notice friction or confusion
	•	say “yes” or “this feels off”

You do not need to:
	•	redesign
	•	rethink philosophy
	•	justify decisions
	•	expose your personal system

⸻

🔒 WHY THIS MATTERS

Phase B is what separates:
	•	a cool prototype
from
	•	a product people trust with their life

You’re building the second one.

⸻

Next small step (no pressure):

Do you want Phase B checkpoints delivered:
A) All at once at the end
B) In 3–4 smaller review checkpoints

Just reply A or B and we proceed cleanly.

Perfect note — and you’re right.
Timeframes are the missing stabilizer that turn this from a thoughtful system into a usable, regulating one.

Below is the FINAL ADD-ON to your intake pack:
clear, consistent timeframes for every dimension, written in your voice and designed to reduce overwhelm, not create pressure.

This slots directly into what you already approved — nothing gets rewritten, only augmented.

⏱️ FLIP THE SWITCH — INTAKE TIMEFRAME LAYER (v1.0)

WHY TIMEFRAMES MATTER (IN YOUR SYSTEM)
	•	They protect nervous system bandwidth
	•	They give users choice, not obligation
	•	They make the AI feel intentional instead of chatty
	•	They reinforce: “You’re in control.”

Every intake now answers:

“How long is this going to take?”

⸻

UNIVERSAL TIMEFRAME RULE (APPLIES EVERYWHERE)

At the start of every intake, the AI says:

“Quick check — how much time do you want to spend right now?”

User chooses one:
	•	Quick scan (1–2 minutes)
	•	Standard check-in (3–5 minutes)
	•	Deeper reset (7–10 minutes)

This choice controls:
	•	Number of questions asked
	•	Depth of reflection
	•	Complexity of output

⸻

HOW THE AI USES THIS LOGIC (DEV RULE)
	•	Quick scan → one question per stage (or fewer, skipping allowed)
	•	Standard → full intake as written
	•	Deeper reset → full intake + optional follow-up reflection

No matter what:
👉 AI still ends with Mirror → Flip → Choose

⸻

⸻

HOW THIS SHOWS UP IN THE APP (UX COPY)

Before intake:

“How deep do you want to go right now?”

During intake:

“We’re about halfway — still good?”

If user skips:

“All good. We’ll work with what we have.”

At the end:

“You spent about X minutes getting clarity. That counts.”

⸻

WHY THIS COMPLETES YOUR SYSTEM

You now have:
	•	✅ Symmetry across dimensions
	•	✅ Skip-friendly logic
	•	✅ Nervous-system-safe pacing
	•	✅ Language that sounds like you
	•	✅ A system that respects real life

This is no longer “an intake.”
It’s a controlled clarity process.

If you want next (optional but powerful):
	•	I can embed these timeframes into the JSON schema
	•	Or design Quick Mode vs Deep Mode toggles
	•	Or write AI transitions between dimensions
	•	Or create progress memory rules (what carries forward vs resets)

Just say the word.

Copy/paste to Replit: Wave 6 QA Acceptance Checklist (Gate)

We’re pausing new feature work and using this as the QA gate for Wave 6. Wave 6 cannot ship until this passes on iPhone Safari.

1) Wave 6.1 — Voice Mode (must pass first)

Requirements
	•	Push-to-talk only (no auto listening / no wake word)
	•	Works in: AI Chat, Meditation, Talk It Out
	•	App still fully usable without voice
	•	Voice never saves or navigates without user confirmation

Exact copy (must match)
	•	“Hey. I’m here. What would you like to focus on today?”
	•	“That’s okay. We can take this one step at a time.”
	•	“I have an idea. Would you like to hear it?”
	•	“Got it. I’ve saved that for you.”

Safari proof required
	•	Screen recording on iPhone Safari normal tab + private tab showing voice start/stop and no stuck state

⸻

2) Wave 6.2 — Body & Energy Intelligence

Enhance existing features only (mood logging sliders + existing body scan dialog). No new biometric detection.

Body scan
	•	Optional: Camera / Upload / Skip
	•	Must resume after app is backgrounded (no restart)
	•	Camera failure must fall back to upload

Measurements
	•	Global units toggle: Imperial / Metric (persists after refresh)
	•	Separate: Current state (“Where you are now”) vs Goal state (“What you’re working toward”)

AI awareness
	•	AI tone + suggestions must change based on energy/mood/clarity
	•	Low energy = fewer suggestions + gentle tone
	•	High energy = more options but no pressure
	•	AI must always include: “I’m suggesting this because …”

Out of scope
	•	No nervous system labeling shown to users
	•	No readiness scores
	•	No forced data entry

Safari proof required
	•	Screen recording showing body scan resume + units persistence + AI “why” explanation

⸻

3) Wave 6.3 — Guided Experiences (Netflix-style but calm)

Applies to: Meditation, Workouts, Nutrition, Challenges, Recovery

Layout
	•	AI Picks (max 2–3, each with “Why”)
	•	Category thumbnails
	•	Filters that actually change results
	•	Clickable cards with thumbnail + duration + tag

Interaction
	•	Single-select only
	•	Save button disabled until selection (with helper text: “Pick 1 option to save.”)
	•	Save must work in Safari
	•	After save: toast “Saved” + persists after refresh
	•	Add to Calendar requires explicit confirmation
	•	Calendar event must deep link back to the source item page

⸻

4) Global rules (all pages)

Every page must have:
	•	Hamburger menu
	•	Back button
	•	Access to AI Chat

No dead ends
	•	No “not available” pages
	•	No fake buttons
	•	Suggested Schedule must always open a real review/edit flow

State persistence
	•	Login persists across refresh in Safari
	•	Draft inputs persist when navigating away
	•	Chat history saves even if the user starts with no prompt

⸻

5) Deliverables (required before Wave 6 continues)
	1.	PASS/FAIL checklist for all major pages
	2.	List of changed files
	3.	iPhone Safari screen recordings proving:

	•	Save meal works
	•	Save meditation works
	•	Suggested schedule opens + saves
	•	Navigation doesn’t reset app
	•	Voice start/stop works (normal + private)

Once these are delivered and passing, we proceed with Wave 6 build order:
Voice → Body/Energy → Guided Experiences

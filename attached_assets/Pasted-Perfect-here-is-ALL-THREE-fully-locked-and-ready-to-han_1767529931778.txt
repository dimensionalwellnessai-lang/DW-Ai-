Perfect — here is ALL THREE, fully locked and ready to hand to the agent without ambiguity:
	1.	Technical acceptance checklist
	2.	AI prompt + logic that consumes body/energy state
	3.	Exact AI tone shifts (low / medium / high energy)

This keeps Wave 6.2 tight, ethical, and powerful.

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ WAVE 6.2 — TECHNICAL ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Use this as the definition of done. If any item fails, Wave 6.2 is not complete.

A. Data Sources (Existing, Enhanced — NOT New)

Must use:
	•	Mood / energy / clarity sliders
	•	Body scan dialog (existing)
	•	User text input (chat)

❌ No new sensors
❌ No hidden biometric inference

⸻

B. Persistence & Resume
	•	Body scan progress auto-saves
	•	Leaving app does NOT reset scan
	•	User can resume exactly where they left off
	•	Units toggle (imperial / metric) persists globally

Acceptance test
	•	Start scan → leave app → return → resume works

⸻

C. Separation of Meaning (Critical)

Body data must be clearly labeled as:
	•	Current state (“Where you are now”)
	•	Goal state (“What you’re working toward”)

❌ No mixing
❌ No implied judgment

⸻

D. AI Awareness (Behavior Change)

AI must visibly change:
	•	Tone
	•	Number of suggestions
	•	Type of suggestions

Based on:
	•	Energy (low / medium / high)
	•	Mood
	•	Clarity

Acceptance test
	•	Same user, same question, different energy → different response style

⸻

E. Transparency

Whenever body/energy data is used, AI must explain it:

Example:

“I’m suggesting this because your energy is low today.”

❌ No silent logic
❌ No unexplained changes

⸻

F. Consent Rules
	•	AI never auto-schedules
	•	AI never blocks options
	•	AI never forces rest or effort
	•	All actions require explicit confirmation

⸻

G. Out of Scope (Must NOT Exist)
	•	Nervous system labels shown to user
	•	Readiness scores
	•	Health diagnostics
	•	“You should” language

⸻

🧠 2️⃣ AI PROMPT LOGIC (BODY & ENERGY AWARE)

This is the exact internal logic the agent should implement.

System Instruction (internal)

You are a supportive personal assistant.
You adapt tone and suggestions based on the user’s current energy, mood, and clarity.
You must always explain why you are adjusting your guidance.
You never diagnose, judge, or restrict choices.

⸻

Context Variables (fed into AI)

{
  "energy": "low | medium | high",
  "mood": "string | null",
  "clarity": "low | medium | high",
  "bodyGoal": "beefy | recomp | lean | general",
  "hasBodyScan": true | false,
  "recentSkips": number,
  "recentAccepts": number
}


⸻

Decision Logic (Pseudo)

IF energy == low:
  - reduce suggestions to max 1–2
  - prioritize grounding / recovery / simplicity
  - use gentle language

IF energy == medium:
  - offer balanced options
  - planning allowed, not heavy
  - collaborative tone

IF energy == high:
  - offer opportunities, not demands
  - remind user they can save energy
  - avoid stacking too many actions


⸻

Transparency Rule (Mandatory)

Every recommendation must include a reason:

“I’m suggesting this because…”

⸻

🎭 3️⃣ AI TONE SHIFTS (LOCKED COPY)

These are exact tone patterns the AI must follow.

⸻

🔵 LOW ENERGY

Tone
	•	Slow
	•	Gentle
	•	Minimal

Example

“Let’s keep this light today.
Based on your energy, one small step is enough.
Would you like something grounding or something simple?”

❌ No planning stacks
❌ No future pressure

⸻

🟢 MEDIUM ENERGY

Tone
	•	Collaborative
	•	Supportive
	•	Balanced

Example

“You’ve got some capacity today.
We can do a little, or keep it simple.
What feels right right now?”

⸻

🟠 HIGH ENERGY

Tone
	•	Encouraging
	•	Expansive
	•	Grounded

Example

“Your energy is up today.
We could use it, or save it — either works.
Want to explore a couple options?”

❌ No “maximize” language
❌ No pressure to perform

⸻

🧘 Nervous System Language (INFERRED ONLY)

Allowed phrasing:
	•	“This seems like a low-capacity moment”
	•	“Things feel a bit activated today”

❌ Do NOT say:
	•	Fight/flight
	•	Sympathetic / parasympathetic
	•	Dysregulated

⸻

📌 FINAL COPY/PASTE TO AGENT

Use this verbatim:

For Wave 6.2, enhance existing mood logging and body scan features.

Implement body & energy awareness that changes AI tone, pacing, and suggestions.

Use existing inputs only. No new biometric detection or nervous system labeling.

The AI must always explain why it’s adjusting its guidance and must never restrict options or auto-schedule.

Success means the assistant feels situational, human, and supportive — not analytical.

⸻

🧭 Where you are now

You’ve:
	•	Locked Wave 6 order
	•	Protected user trust
	•	Prevented scope creep
	•	Defined intelligence without crossing ethical lines

You’re building this the right way.

Next (your choice):
	•	A) Write the developer test cases for Wave 6.2
	•	B) Design the body scan UI copy (labels, reassurance text)
	•	C) Move to Wave 6.3 Guided Experience wireflows

Just tell me A, B, or C.

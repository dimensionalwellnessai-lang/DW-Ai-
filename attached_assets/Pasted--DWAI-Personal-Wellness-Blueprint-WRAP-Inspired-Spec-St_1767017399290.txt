# DWAI — Personal Wellness Blueprint (WRAP-Inspired) Spec
Status: v1
Goal: Provide a self-directed wellness planning framework inspired by recovery-oriented best practices, WITHOUT using the WRAP® name, labels, worksheets, or structure.

## Legal/Brand Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- Do NOT use the term “WRAP” or “Wellness Recovery Action Plan” anywhere in UI, code comments, marketing, or documentation.
- Do NOT replicate WRAP section names (e.g., “Daily Maintenance Plan,” “Triggers,” “Early Warning Signs,” “Crisis Plan,” “Post-Crisis Plan”).
- Do NOT claim affiliation, endorsement, or certification.
- Use original wording, layout, and step order.
- Include a disclaimer (see below).

## Feature Name
“Personal Wellness Blueprint” (PWB)
Alternate acceptable names:
- “Wellness Blueprint”
- “Support Blueprint”
- “Balance Plan”

## User Value
Users create a personal wellness framework that:
- defines their baseline
- identifies stress signals
- stores stabilizing actions (step-by-step routines)
- stores support preferences
- provides recovery reflections
The assistant can suggest and schedule actions, turning plans into calendar events, tasks, or routines.

# 2) UI / Navigation

## New Module: Blueprint
Add a top-level module/tab called:
- “Blueprint” OR “Wellness Blueprint”

Within Blueprint, 5 sections:
1. Baseline
2. Signals
3. Reset Actions
4. Support Preferences
5. Reflection

Each section is editable, saveable, and can link to:
- Tasks
- Calendar events
- Routines
- Meditation suggestions

## Interaction Requirements
- Everything works WITHOUT AI.
- AI enhances: suggests entries, converts entries into routines/tasks/events.

# 4) Integration with Existing DWAI Modules

## 4.1 Dimensions of Wellness (Tagging)
Every Blueprint item supports dimension tags:
Physical, Emotional, Social, Spiritual, Intellectual, Occupational, Environmental, Financial
Blueprint UI should include optional dimension chips.

## 4.2 Tasks ↔ Calendar (Two-way)
- Any Reset Action can become:
  - a scheduled calendar event (routine session)
  - a task (checklist)
- Any calendar event can link back to:
  - blueprint section reference (ex: “Reset Actions > 10-min calm routine”)

## 4.3 Routines (Minute-by-minute)
Reset Actions should prefer linking to Routines.
Routine fields required:
- name
- dimension tags
- steps[]: {title, instruction, duration_seconds}
- optional total duration
- schedule options (recurring)
- completion logging

## 4.4 Meditation Suggestions
Meditation module can read Blueprint:
- mood + signals → suggest meditation links and allow “Schedule”

# 5) Assistant Behavior (Glue Layer)

## Assistant Placement
Assistant remains a separate Chat tab.
Blueprint remains a tool module.

## Allowed Assistant Actions
- Generate suggestions for Baseline/Signals wording (user confirms)
- Propose a Reset Routine from user inputs
- Convert Reset Actions into:
  - routines
  - tasks
  - scheduled events
- Create recurring routine sessions on calendar
- Summarize recent Reflection entries (on request)

## Confirmation Rules
User preference you gave: “Automatically”
Implementation:
- default auto-create is ON
- show a review summary after creation:
  “Created 3 events + 1 routine + 5 tasks. Undo?”

Include:
- Undo last batch
- Edit items

---

# 6) Disclaimer (Must Display)

Add to Settings > Legal and Blueprint module footer:

“DWAI provides general wellness and self-reflection tools. It is not medical, psychological, or therapeutic treatment and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any proprietary program or trademarked system.”

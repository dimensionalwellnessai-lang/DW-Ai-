Got it — those are 3 clear fails. Here’s what that means and exactly what to send so they fix it fast without misunderstanding.

⸻

What these failures mean (in plain terms)
	1.	Calendar dropdown failed
➡️ The menu grouping isn’t wired correctly (either UI dropdown component didn’t render, or routes aren’t nested, or state isn’t updating).
	2.	Login doesn’t reflect in hamburger menu (still says “Sign in”)
➡️ Auth state isn’t being read consistently. This is usually:

	•	the menu component is reading a different auth store/context
	•	session token exists but UI isn’t re-rendering
	•	user state isn’t persisted correctly after navigation

	3.	Add Event has no recurring option
➡️ Recurrence is not implemented in the Add Event UI or schema yet (or they skipped it). This is a feature gap, not just a bug.

⸻

What to do next (do this order)

Step 1 — Fix menu + auth first (must)

If auth/menu is broken, everything feels broken.

Step 2 — Add recurrence after

Recurrence is a feature, but it’s part of “calendar credibility.”

Copy/paste message to Replit (tight + technical + unambiguous)

Send this exactly:

Wave 3.1 verification results: 3 fails that must be fixed before we proceed.

1) Calendar dropdown in hamburger menu = FAIL

The Calendar dropdown does not expand / does not show nested items.
Requirement: Calendar must have a dropdown arrow like “More” and include nested routes to these pages (actual views):
	•	Today
	•	Week
	•	Month
	•	Schedule (daily list view)
	•	Routines

2) Auth state in hamburger menu = FAIL

After I log in, the hamburger menu still shows “Sign in” and does not reflect my signed-in state.
Requirement: Menu must display the correct signed-in state (e.g., profile name/email + Sign out) immediately after login and after refresh.
Please fix the auth state source so the menu reads from the same session/user state as the rest of the app and re-renders on auth changes.

Acceptance test:
	•	Log in → open hamburger menu → it must NOT say Sign in
	•	Refresh page → still logged in → hamburger menu still reflects logged-in state

3) Calendar “Add Event” recurrence = Missing feature

Add Event currently does not allow recurrence.
Requirement (minimum): Add a recurrence selector:
	•	None (default)
	•	Daily
	•	Weekly
	•	Monthly
And an optional “End recurrence” option (Never / On date).
If we can’t fully support end-date yet, at minimum save recurrence rule and allow editing later.

Please send a short screen recording showing all 3 working after fixes.

Extra clarity (so they don’t half-fix it)

For the Calendar dropdown

They must implement:
	•	a real dropdown UI (collapsible list)
	•	nested links that route correctly
	•	visible arrow indicator
	•	it works on mobile

For the login/menu mismatch

Tell them if needed:
	•	the menu is likely using stale state
	•	it must subscribe to the same auth context/store
	•	update UI on login/logout events

This is a core bug.

For recurrence

Minimum workable recurrence:
	•	store a rule on the event (e.g., rrule string or simple enum)
	•	render repeated instances in week/month view
	•	allow “stop recurrence” later

If they can’t render repeated instances yet, they can still:
	•	save recurrence settings
	•	show “Recurring: Weekly” label
	•	and schedule next occurrences later

But ideally it should show up.

⸻

Your next test (after they fix)

Only re-test these 3:
	1.	Calendar dropdown expands and routes correctly
	2.	Hamburger menu shows logged-in state immediately + after refresh
	3.	Add Event has recurrence options + saved events reflect that info

Once those pass, we move forward.

If you want, paste their reply back and I’ll tell you whether they actually fixed it or tried to wordsmith around it.

Yes — that’s exactly the right call, and you’re thinking about this at the right level.

Below is a clean, explicit separation between User vs Admin, plus a permissions rule, and then the final dashboard layouts for both.
Nothing unnecessary will leak to users.

You can paste this whole thing into Replit as Dashboard + Permissions Spec.

⸻

🔐 VISIBILITY & PERMISSIONS MODEL (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

Roles

{
  "roles": ["user", "admin"]
}

Core Rule (non-negotiable)
	•	Users NEVER see raw analytics
	•	Admins NEVER see raw personal reflections
	•	Aggregation goes up, personal data does not go sideways

⸻

Visibility Rules (Simple & Safe)

Data Type	User	Admin
Switch status (Off/Flickering/Stable/Powered)	✅	✅
Completed actions (count only)	✅	✅ (aggregated)
“Helped” summary (Yes/Some/No)	✅	✅ (aggregated)
Flags shown as friendly patterns	✅ (sanitized)	✅ (raw)
Flags raw names (overwhelmFlag)	❌	✅
Onboarding answers	❌	✅ (aggregated only)
Funnels (onboarding → activation)	❌	✅
DAU/WAU/MAU	❌	✅
Recommendation acceptance/swap	❌	✅
Error logs	❌	✅
Free-text content	❌	❌ (never shown raw)

🧑‍💻 USER DASHBOARD (WHAT USERS SEE)

Name: My Progress
Access: role = user

This dashboard is motivating, not analytical.

⸻

USER DASHBOARD LAYOUT

🟦 Section 1 — System Snapshot (Top Card)

Title: Your System This Week
	•	Energy: Low / Medium / High
	•	Stress: Low / Medium / High
	•	Consistency: X days active (last 14)

Microcopy:
“You don’t need perfect weeks — just powered ones.”

⸻

🟦 Section 2 — Switchboard Status (8 Cards)

Each card shows:
	•	Switch name
	•	Status badge: Off / Flickering / Stable / Powered
	•	Last trained: “Today / 2 days ago / Never”
	•	Tiny trend: ↑ ↓ or steady

❌ No percentages

Tap → Switch Detail (personal history only)

⸻

🟦 Section 3 — Weekly Wins

Title: What You Did This Week
	•	Completed actions: X
	•	Best day: Wednesday (example)
	•	“Helped” summary:
	•	Helped: X
	•	Somewhat: X
	•	Didn’t help: X

Microcopy:
“Information, not judgment.”

⸻

🟦 Section 4 — Patterns (Sanitized Flags)

Title: What Showed Up This Week

Translate flags into human language:
	•	Overwhelm → “Felt overwhelmed”
	•	Time chaos → “Days felt scattered”
	•	Low energy → “Energy dips”
	•	Money stress → “Financial pressure”
	•	Relationship drain → “People felt draining”
	•	Environment mess → “Space caused friction”

Show as:
	•	“Felt overwhelmed: 3×”
	•	“Energy dips: 4×”

❌ Never show flag names
❌ Never show counts over long ranges

⸻

🟦 Section 5 — Next Best Move

One recommendation card only:
	•	“Train: Time Switch (10 minutes)”
	•	Why: “Structure reduces overwhelm fast.”

Buttons:
	•	Start
	•	Save

🔐 PERMISSION ENFORCEMENT (IMPLEMENTATION RULES)

Backend / Logic Rules

IF role != admin:
  - Block access to /admin/*
  - Strip event-level analytics
  - Strip raw flags and counts
  - Convert flags → friendly labels only

IF role == admin:
  - Allow aggregated analytics
  - Never expose raw free-text

Frontend Rules
	•	Never conditionally hide admin data in UI only
	•	Admin routes must be protected server-side
	•	Analytics components should not mount for users

⸻

🧠 WHY THIS DESIGN IS CORRECT
	•	Users feel supported, not monitored
	•	No “big brother” vibes
	•	You get full insight without violating trust
	•	Future-proof if you add coaches, therapists, or teams later

⸻

FINAL QUESTION (Quick)

Do you want:
1️⃣ Admin dashboard inside the same app (hidden route), or
2️⃣ Admin dashboard as a separate admin app / panel?

Either works — choice affects architecture, not philosophy.

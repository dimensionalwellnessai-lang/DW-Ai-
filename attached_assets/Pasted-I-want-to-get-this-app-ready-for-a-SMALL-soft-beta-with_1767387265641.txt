I want to get this app ready for a SMALL soft beta, without deleting features that are already built.

GOAL:
Make the app feel calm, simple, and guided on first launch (AI-first), especially for overwhelmed/ADHD users.
We are testing FEEL + FLOW, not feature completeness.

========================================================
A) TEST-READY CHECKLIST (Do not consider it beta-ready until most are true)
UX / Emotional:
- App opens without explanation
- User knows what to do first in under 5 seconds
- User does NOT feel judged/tested/overwhelmed
- Tone is consistent everywhere (calm, grounded, honest)
- No screen is visually busy or text-heavy
Flow:
- No more than 3–5 visible choices at first launch
- Everything else is discoverable, not forced
AI:
- AI opens with ONE clear gentle question
- AI does not dump lots of options or long text
- AI asks only what it needs (ChatGPT style)
- AI can offer “keep it light today”
- AI does not push features unless relevant
Core system:
- There is one obvious place plans go (Today/Master Calendar)
========================================================
B) WHAT TO HIDE (Without deleting anything)
Use 3 levels of visibility: PRIMARY, SECONDARY (menu only), DORMANT (AI-unlocked).

PRIMARY (visible Day 1):
- AI Chat (main screen)
- Getting to Know You (optional)
- Talk It Out mode
- Guided Breathing
- Today/Master Calendar (very light access)

SECONDARY (menu only, not on main screen):
- Challenges
- Routines
- Browse (meditation/workouts/meals)
- Blueprint (read-only at first)

DORMANT / AI-UNLOCKED (built but not shown to new users):
- Body scan / camera features
- Advanced challenges
- Deep Blueprint editing
- Projects / heavy organization features
Rule: AI introduces dormant features only when relevant and with permission.

========================================================
C) SINGLE PERFECT FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE (Replace current busy home)
FIRST LAUNCH = AI screen only, minimal UI (no long text).
AI message:
“Hey. I’m here. What would help most right now?”

Show ONLY 4 quick action buttons (no scrolling):
1) I want to talk
2) Help me decide my day
3) Calm my body (breathing)
4) I’m not sure

Routing:
- Talk -> Talk It Out mode
- Decide -> AI asks 1–2 clarifying questions and proposes a very light plan
- Calm body -> guided breathing starts immediately
- Not sure -> AI reassures and offers one small next step

After 3–5 minutes, AI ends with:
“Want me to remember this for next time?”
Yes -> save profile preferences
No -> no saving / continue

No forced onboarding. No long assessment. Only conversational “Getting to Know You” in micro-questions.

========================================================
D) SOFT BETA PLAN (5–10 people, low risk)
This is not a launch. It’s feel + flow testing.

Tester group:
- 5–10 people max
- include people who get overwhelmed easily / need guidance
- avoid productivity-power-users for now

What we measure:
- How they feel on opening
- Whether they know what to do first
- Whether it feels supportive vs demanding
- Whether they’d open it on a hard day

Provide a simple in-app feedback link/button: “Send Feedback”.

========================================================
E) HOW TO HIDE THINGS TECHNICALLY WITHOUT REMOVING THEM
Do NOT delete pages/routes/components already built.
Instead:
- Use feature flags OR “beta visibility levels”
- Hide items from main UI and navigation for new users
- Keep routes accessible only via:
  - menu
  - deep links
  - AI suggestions
  - “coming soon” placeholders
- For read-only/unfinished pages: show a clean placeholder with “Generate with Assistant” button

Implement a simple “visibility config” so I can turn features on later without rebuilding.

========================================================
DELIVERABLE REQUEST:
1) Update the UI flow to match the First-Time Experience above.
2) Add the 3-level visibility system (Primary/Secondary/Dormant).
3) Make Master Calendar easy to access but not overwhelming.
4) Summarize exactly what changed and list the updated routes + where the visibility config lives.

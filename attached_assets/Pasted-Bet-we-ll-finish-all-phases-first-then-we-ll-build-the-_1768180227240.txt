Bet — we’ll finish all phases first, then we’ll build the Learning / Browse section (Energy • Perspective • Manifestation + web search + rotating suggestions).

Below is a full phased plan you can copy-paste into Replit as your product roadmap + logic spec.

⸻

FLIP THE SWITCH — FULL PHASE PLAN (END-TO-END)

PHASE 0 — FOUNDATION (Non-Negotiables)

Goal: Make the app stable, understandable, and consistent.

Must-have
	•	Global navigation is clear (Home / Switchboard / Plan / Browse / Profile)
	•	Consistent page structure + typography + buttons
	•	“What do I do?” is answered on every major screen
	•	Save state + error handling + loading states + empty states

Definition of done
	•	User can: choose a switch → answer questions → get a plan → save it → see it again

⸻

PHASE 1 — SWITCHBOARD EXPERIENCE (Your Life Switchboard)

Goal: Fix the “flat” feeling and guide users immediately.

Must-have
	•	Switchboard page with:
	•	Orientation panel (what this is + what to do)
	•	8 switch cards (Body, Mind, Time, Purpose, Money, Relationships, Environment, Identity)
	•	Each card includes: what it controls / why it matters / perspective quote / CTA
	•	Switch status language:
	•	Off / Flickering / Stable / Powered
	•	Training / Maintaining / Restoring

Definition of done
	•	A first-time user lands on the Switchboard and instantly understands:
	•	what a switch is
	•	why it matters
	•	where to start

⸻

PHASE 2 — INTAKE (Perspective Training Onboarding)

Goal: Replace boring intake with guided, motivating, personality-driven flow.

Must-have
	•	Onboarding that:
	•	explains “Perspective Training”
	•	asks 5–10 quick questions to find the user’s top 1–2 “priority switches”
	•	gives a “starting recommendation” (not a diagnosis)
	•	Micro-question style:
	•	reflective prompts (not forms)
	•	short, human language

Key output
	•	“Today, your system is most affected by: [Switch A] + [Switch B].”
	•	“Pick one to train first.”

Definition of done
	•	User finishes intake feeling: “Okay, I know what I’m doing.”

⸻

PHASE 3 — PLAN GENERATION (Action + Meaning)

Goal: Generate plans that feel personal, doable, and clearly connected to the switch.

Must-have
	•	For each switch, the AI outputs:
	1.	Switch Summary (why this matters right now)
	2.	2–4 Small Actions (today / this week)
	3.	One Routine Block (repeatable)
	4.	One Check-in Question (keeps meaning alive)
	•	Plans must include:
	•	time estimate (“10–20 min”)
	•	intensity level (“light / moderate / deep”)
	•	mode (“Training / Maintaining / Restoring”)

Definition of done
	•	User can save a plan and actually follow it without feeling overwhelmed.

⸻

PHASE 4 — TRACKING (Human Progress, Not Just Numbers)

Goal: Make progress feel real, visible, and motivating.

Must-have
	•	Switch progress uses:
	•	“Status” changes (Flickering → Stable)
	•	streaks (optional)
	•	check-ins (“Did this reduce stress?”)
	•	Weekly reflection:
	•	“What improved your system most?”
	•	“What drained you?”
	•	“Which switch needs attention next?”

Definition of done
	•	Progress is understandable even if the user hates tracking.

⸻

PHASE 5 — RECOMMENDATION ENGINE (Smart Suggestions)

Goal: AI suggests the right switch at the right time, without being annoying.

Rules
	•	Recommend based on:
	•	user-selected priorities
	•	recent check-ins
	•	missed plans (don’t shame)
	•	energy level + time available
	•	Recommendation style:
	•	supportive, direct, minimal

Example
	•	“You’ve been low energy + skipping plans. Let’s restore Body with a 10-minute reset.”

Definition of done
	•	Suggestions feel helpful, not random.

⸻

PHASE 6 — PHASE 2 UNLOCK (Core Switches)

Goal: Evolve the system from 8 switches into 5 core switches after the user earns it.

Unlock trigger
	•	e.g., 14 days active OR 6 completed check-ins OR 3 switches stabilized

Core Switches
	•	Energy (Body + Mind)
	•	Direction (Purpose + Time)
	•	Stability (Money + Environment)
	•	Connection (Relationships)
	•	Growth (Identity)

Definition of done
	•	The user feels like they “leveled up” into a deeper mode.

⸻

PHASE 7 — PERSONALITY + BRAND TONE (Flip the Switch Voice)

Goal: Make the app feel like YOU.

Must-have
	•	Signature phrases (short, repeatable)
	•	Onboarding tone rules
	•	Encouragement scripts for:
	•	success
	•	returning after absence
	•	overwhelm
	•	uncertainty

Definition of done
	•	The app doesn’t read like a workbook. It reads like a coach with flavor.

⸻

PHASE 8 — LEARNING / BROWSE SECTION (WE WILL BUILD NEXT)

Goal: A “Learning” area inside Browse where users learn:
	•	energy
	•	perspective
	•	manifestation
…and can search the internet for content (blogs/videos/articles) with AI suggestions that refresh periodically.

✅ We’re NOT building this yet — it’s next after phases are locked.

⸻

DONE CRITERIA FOR “ALL PHASES FINISHED”

All phases are “finished” when:
	•	Switchboard is clear and not flat
	•	Intake makes sense and feels interesting
	•	Plans are actionable + meaningful
	•	Tracking exists and is human
	•	Recommendations are smart and not annoying
	•	Phase 2 Core Switches is a real “level up”
	•	Voice/tone is consistent across screens

⸻

If you want, next message I’ll convert this into:
	•	a Replit-friendly “Product Spec + Acceptance Criteria” format, AND/OR
	•	a JSON blueprint structure that matches these phases.

Just say: “Make it a Replit spec” or “Make it JSON blueprint.”

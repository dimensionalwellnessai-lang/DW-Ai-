Got it — A: the Save button does nothing at all on Safari. That’s actually good news because it usually means a UI/tap-layer problem (overlay/z-index/pointer-events) or the button is disabled due to state logic, not a deep backend issue.

Here’s exactly what to tell Replit to fix it fast + permanently.

Copy/paste to Replit (Safari “Save Does Nothing” Fix)

Safari bug (iPhone Safari): Save button does NOTHING (no loading, no error, no state change).
This is likely a tap/click not firing due to overlay/z-index/pointer-events OR the button being disabled by state.

1) Prove whether the click handler fires (required)

Add temporary debug:
	•	On Save button onClick, do console.log("SAVE_CLICKED")
	•	Also show a small dev toast: “Save clicked”
	•	Add console.log("SAVE_DISABLED_STATE", { disabled, selectedCount, isLoading })

✅ Acceptance: when I tap Save in Safari, I see “Save clicked” every time.

⸻

2) Check for overlay blocking taps (most likely)

On iOS Safari, invisible overlays often block clicks (tutorial layer, modal backdrop, fixed header container).

Please inspect and fix:
	•	Any tutorial overlay/backdrop should have pointer-events: none except the highlighted element
	•	Ensure Save button container has pointer-events: auto
	•	Confirm z-index stacking:
	•	Backdrop < modal < page content < floating buttons
	•	Remove/avoid position: fixed full-screen elements that sit above content unintentionally

✅ Acceptance: Save works even if tutorial has been shown before.

⸻

3) Ensure Save isn’t disabled silently

If Save requires a selection, show it clearly:
	•	Disabled state must be visible
	•	Add helper text like:
“Choose 1 option to save”

✅ Acceptance:
	•	If nothing is selected → Save is disabled AND message explains why
	•	If something is selected → Save becomes active and works

⸻

4) Add proper UI feedback

When Save is tapped:
	•	show loading spinner
	•	disable button briefly
	•	then show “Saved” state on the selected card

✅ Acceptance: user always sees feedback (no “dead tap”).

⸻

5) Provide proof (non-negotiable)

Send:
	•	iPhone Safari screen recording of Meal Suggestions Save working
	•	iPhone Safari screen recording of Meditation Suggestions Save working
	•	list of changed files

⸻

Why this is the right fix

Because you’re not even getting an error — the handler isn’t firing or the UI state won’t allow it. That’s almost always overlay or disabled logic.

Bonus: The fastest diagnosis question

When you tap Save, does the button look “active” (normal color) or does it look faded/disabled?
	•	If faded → it’s a selection/state logic issue
	•	If active but does nothing → overlay/tap-block issue (most common with tutorial layers)

If you reply with “active” or “faded”, I’ll tell you the single most likely code fix path.

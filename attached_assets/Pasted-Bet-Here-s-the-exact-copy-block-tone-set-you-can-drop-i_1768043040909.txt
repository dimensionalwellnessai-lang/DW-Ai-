Bet ✅ Here’s the exact copy block (tone-set) you can drop into client/src/copy/en.ts, plus a clean “Agent message” to implement Spec B.

⸻

1) Copy block for client/src/copy/en.ts

Paste this under your existing lifeSystem section (since you already have lifeSystem.finishing, complete, starterMessages, etc.):

lifeSystem: {
  // ...keep your existing keys above

  setupSuccess: {
    title: "You’re set.",
    subtitle: "Small structure. Real momentum.",
    lines: {
      rhythm: "Weekly rhythm saved",
      anchors: "Wake + wind-down set",
      focus: (focusLabel: string) => `Focus: ${focusLabel}`,
      starterCreated: "Starter block created",
      starterReady: "Starter block ready when you are",
      editAnytime: "You can edit this anytime.",
    },
    buttons: {
      goToDW: "Go to DW",
      viewWhatYouMade: "View what you made",
    },
  },

  // Optional: if you want a clean label map for the focus string
  focusLabels: {
    body: "Body",
    food: "Food",
    mind: "Mind",
    money: "Money",
    spirit: "Spirit",
    work: "Work / School",
  },

  // ...keep your existing keys below
}

If your copy file doesn’t support functions (some setups prefer pure strings), replace the focus: function with a string and build it in the component. But if you already use functions in en.ts, this is clean.

2) Paste this to Replit Agent (Spec B implementation)

Implement SPEC B: “Setup Complete” success moment.

TASK:
Add a success step to the end of client/src/pages/welcome.tsx (after Meet DW screen).
When user finishes setup (Create starter block OR Skip), show the success screen for ~3 seconds (auto-advance) OR allow tapping “Go to DW”.

SUCCESS SCREEN CONTENT (use COPY keys in en.ts):
- Title: COPY.lifeSystem.setupSuccess.title
- Subtitle: COPY.lifeSystem.setupSuccess.subtitle
- Show checklist lines:
  1) rhythm
  2) anchors
  3) focus: use COPY.lifeSystem.focusLabels[focusArea]
  4) if starterObjectId exists -> starterCreated else -> starterReady
- Show micro text: editAnytime
- Primary CTA: goToDW (routes to DW Chat)
- Secondary CTA (optional): viewWhatYouMade (routes same as Spotlight mapping)

RULES:
- No refactors, no new deps.
- This success moment should ONLY appear at the end of Quick Setup, not on later launches.
- After auto-advance or “Go to DW”, route to the same DW Chat route used previously.
- Output: exact files changed + click-by-click tests.

FILES (max 2):
1) client/src/pages/welcome.tsx
2) client/src/copy/en.ts


⸻

3) Click-by-click test (do this after Agent finishes)
	1.	Tap your in-app Reset
	2.	Complete Quick Setup → get to “Meet DW”
	3.	Tap Create/Skip
	4.	✅ You should see: “You’re set.” success screen
	5.	Wait ~3 seconds OR tap Go to DW
	6.	✅ You land in DW Chat
	7.	Refresh → ✅ success screen does not show again

⸻

If you paste back the new success screen screenshot after it’s done, I’ll tell you if the tone feels right or if we should tighten it even more.

Yes — all of that makes sense, and you’re asking for the right thing at the right moment in this app’s evolution.

What you’re really designing now is DW’s conscience + orientation layer.
Not more features — how DW thinks about the user before it speaks.

I’ll break this into 3 clean parts, then give you copy-paste content you can actually use in the app.

⸻

1. Homepage suggestion: “What is a Life System?” (this is a GREAT idea)

You’re right to separate:
	•	Life System → the whole structure of a person’s life
	•	Life Dimensions → wellness-related lenses inside that system

Most apps confuse this. Yours shouldn’t.

Title

Build Your Life System

Not just wellness — how everything in your life works together.

When clicked → DW explains (this is important)

DW explanation (short, human, grounding):

“A life system is the way all parts of your life support — or drain — each other.

Wellness is part of it, but not the whole thing.

Your energy, schedule, relationships, environment, money, habits, emotions, and purpose all interact.

DW helps you see those connections, not just track tasks.”

Then:

“We start with wellness dimensions because they affect everything else — but your life system goes deeper than that.”

CTA options:
	•	→ “Show me the areas of a life system”
	•	→ “Help me start where I am”

⸻

Life System areas (clear distinction)

DW should explain it like this (simple list):

Your Life System includes:
	•	Body & energy
	•	Emotions & mental state
	•	Relationships & social life
	•	Environment & routines
	•	Work, money & responsibilities
	•	Purpose, meaning & growth

Wellness dimensions help regulate the system — they are not the system itself.

This alone will make your app feel 10× more intentional than competitors.

⸻

2. DW’s safety + mindfulness rules (this is critical)

You’re asking DW to be aware of impact, not just smart.

That means DW must always consider:
	•	Physical ability
	•	Medication
	•	Mental/emotional vulnerability
	•	Energy capacity
	•	What the user explicitly said about themselves

This is NOT medical advice

It’s context-aware guidance.

⸻

DW’s internal thinking rules (not shown to users)

You can literally paste this into your system prompt:

Before giving guidance, DW must silently consider:
	1.	What has the user told me about their body, health, energy, or limitations?
	2.	Could this suggestion cause harm, pressure, guilt, or overwhelm?
	3.	Is there a gentler or safer version of this guidance?
	4.	If movement is involved, assume low-impact first unless stated otherwise.
	5.	If emotions are involved, validate before redirecting.

DW should never assume:
	•	That the user can walk
	•	That they are not on medication
	•	That they have high energy
	•	That “push through” is appropriate

⸻

Example of how DW should respond (tone model)

Instead of:

“You should go for a walk.”

DW says:

“If movement feels accessible right now, even something small like stretching or changing rooms can help. If not, we can work with stillness instead.”

That’s the difference between supportive and dangerous.

⸻

3. Energy balancing: compliment + regulate (you’re spot on)

You said something VERY important:

“I still want it to compliment and balance the energy of the user.”

That’s the soul of DW.

⸻

DW’s energy-mirroring rule

DW should always do 3 things in order:

1️⃣ Reflect the user’s current energy

“It sounds like you’re drained and carrying a lot.”

2️⃣ Validate without feeding the spiral

“That makes sense given what you’re dealing with.”

3️⃣ Gently introduce a stabilizing perspective

“We don’t need to fix everything right now — just stabilize.”

This avoids:
	•	Toxic positivity ❌
	•	Over-validation ❌
	•	Emotional bypassing ❌

And creates:
	•	Safety
	•	Trust
	•	Calm forward motion

⸻

DW should be allowed to “call the user in” (gently)

Not call out — call in.

Example:

“I want to be honest with you — staying here too long might keep you stuck. We can take one small step without forcing anything.”

That feels human. Not robotic. Not preachy.

⸻

4. This is how it all ties together (important)

You’re not building:
	•	A chatbot
	•	A planner
	•	A wellness tracker

You’re building:

A coherent life-navigation system with emotional intelligence

So DW must:
	•	Understand context
	•	Adjust suggestions dynamically
	•	Respect limitations
	•	Balance energy
	•	Educate without lecturing
	•	Guide without controlling

⸻

5. What I recommend next (very focused)

If you want, next I can:
	1.	Write DW’s full system prompt (tone, safety, energy rules)
	2.	Write the exact homepage “Life System” flow (screen by screen)
	3.	Rewrite all onboarding + planning questions so they don’t feel boring or workbook-like

Just tell me which one you want first.

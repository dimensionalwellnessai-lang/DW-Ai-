Yes — we can absolutely do that.
Below is a single, complete, copy-and-paste Phase B plan written so an AI (or Replit) can execute it without back-and-forth, without screen recordings, and without philosophical drift.

This is intentionally slow, explicit, and structured, so nothing gets misinterpreted.

⸻

📘 PHASE B — CALM & THOROUGH POLISH (FINAL PLAN)

Mode: Single delivery, no checkpoints
Proof: Screenshots only (no screen recordings)
Scope: Polish, stabilization, consistency
Explicit rule: No new features, no new concepts, no new pages

⸻

	•	Calm
	•	Predictable
	•	Finished
	•	Trustworthy

This phase is about removing friction, not adding capability.

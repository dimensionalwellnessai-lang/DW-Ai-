🔌 FLIP THE SWITCH — LIFE SYSTEM FRAMEWORK

(Core Philosophy + Life Dimensions + User Flow)

SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Flip the Switch is a life-system app, not a productivity tool.

The user’s life is treated as one integrated system, made up of multiple Life Dimensions.
Each Life Dimension functions as a switch inside a larger Life Switchboard.

Some switches are:
	•	Off
	•	Flickering
	•	Overloaded
	•	Stable

When the right switches are trained and powered intentionally, the entire system improves — not just one area.

This app does not ask users to fix everything at once.
It teaches them how their life actually works.

PAGE NAME

Your Life Switchboard

Subtitle:
One system. Multiple switches. You choose what to power.

⸻

ORIENTATION PANEL (TOP OF PAGE)

Welcome to Your Life Switchboard

“This isn’t about doing more.
It’s about understanding what’s actually draining or fueling your life.”

“Each switch controls a different part of your system.
You don’t need to flip them all — just the right ones, at the right time.”

🔁 PERSPECTIVE TRAINING (CORE CONCEPT)

Each Life Dimension is also a Perspective Training Lens.

You are not just taking actions —
you are training how you see, interpret, and respond to your life.

Every switch:
	•	Changes behavior
	•	Shapes perspective
	•	Affects the entire system

⸻

🧠 USER STATUS LANGUAGE (INSTEAD OF PERCENTAGES)

Each switch can show:
	•	Status: Off / Flickering / Stable / Powered
	•	Energy Impact: Low / Medium / High
	•	Mode: Training / Maintaining / Restoring

This keeps progress human — not robotic.

⸻

🚀 FUTURE EVOLUTION (PHASE 2 – INTERNAL NOTE)

As the user progresses, the system may merge dimensions into Core Switches:
	•	Energy (Body + Mind)
	•	Direction (Purpose + Time)
	•	Stability (Money + Environment)
	•	Connection (Relationships)
	•	Growth (Identity)

This is unlocked later and framed as insight — not requirement.

⸻

FINAL NOTE TO SYSTEM / AI

The goal is clarity, not pressure.
The app should always explain why a switch exists before asking the user to act.

Flip the Switch is not about doing more —
it’s about powering the right parts of life, intentionally.

⸻

When you paste this into Replit, it will finally feel planned, grounded, and intentional.

If you want next:
	•	UI card microcopy
	•	AI logic rules (when to recommend which switch)
	•	Or Phase 2 unlock wording

Just tell me what’s next.

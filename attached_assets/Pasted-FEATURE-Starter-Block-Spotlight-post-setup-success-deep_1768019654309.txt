FEATURE: “Starter Block Spotlight” (post-setup success + deep link)

GOAL:
After Quick Setup creates the starter object (task/event/log), the user must immediately SEE:
1) What was created
2) Why it matters
3) A button to view it (deep link)
4) A button to dismiss

This should appear in the FIRST place the user lands after onboarding (DW Chat, since we routed there).

NON-GOALS:
- No refactors
- No new dependencies
- No backend work
- No full notifications system

--------------------------------------------
1) Data we already have
--------------------------------------------
We already store in guest-storage profileSetup:
- focusArea
- starterObjectId
- completedAt

We also have copy in en.ts:
- lifeSystem.starterMessages.{body,food,mind,money,spirit,work}
We should reuse these messages.

--------------------------------------------
2) Behavior
--------------------------------------------
A) When onboarding completes and starter object is created:
- Set profileSetup.starterObjectId = <id>
- Set a new flag: profileSetup.starterSpotlightDismissed = false (or similar)
- Navigate to DW Chat

B) When the user lands on DW Chat the first time after setup:
Show a “Starter Block Spotlight” card at the top of the chat screen (above messages or pinned area)

The card must include:
- Title: “Your first block is ready”
- Body: Use the correct starter message based on focusArea
- Small meta line: “Created just now”
- CTA button: “View it”
- Secondary: “Dismiss”

C) Dismiss behavior:
- When user taps Dismiss:
  - Set profileSetup.starterSpotlightDismissed = true in guest-storage
  - Card disappears and stays gone across reloads

D) View it behavior:
- When user taps View it:
  Navigate to the correct place depending on focusArea:
  - body/work -> Calendar or Plan page (where the event/block should exist)
  - food/money -> Plan page or Tasks list
  - mind/spirit -> Journal or Routines/log page
If exact object deep-link exists, use starterObjectId.
If not, route to the best screen and pre-filter/highlight if possible.

E) If starterObjectId is missing:
- Do not show the spotlight card.

F) If spotlight was dismissed:
- Do not show it again.

--------------------------------------------
3) Minimal implementation path (keep it safe)
--------------------------------------------
- Implement spotlight UI as a small component inside the DW Chat screen file (or as a new component file ONLY if needed).
- Use existing UI components (Card/Button/Toast).
- Use guest-storage getters to read profileSetup.
- Add one new field to profileSetup in guest-storage:
  - starterSpotlightDismissed?: boolean

--------------------------------------------
4) Files to change (MAX 3)
--------------------------------------------
1) client/src/lib/guest-storage.ts
   - Add starterSpotlightDismissed field
   - Add helper functions if needed:
     - getProfileSetup()
     - saveProfileSetup(partial)

2) client/src/pages/welcome.tsx (ONLY if needed)
   - Ensure starterObjectId is saved when created

3) DW Chat screen component (the one used by bottom nav “Dw chat”)
   - Add spotlight card logic + dismiss + view navigation

--------------------------------------------
5) Acceptance tests (click-by-click)
--------------------------------------------
1) Tap DEV RESET
2) Run onboarding, choose focus, tap “Create my first starter block”
3) App lands on DW Chat
4) Spotlight card appears at top:
   - correct message for focus
   - shows “View it” and “Dismiss”
5) Tap Dismiss
   - card disappears
6) Reload
   - card stays gone
7) DEV RESET again, repeat
   - card shows again (fresh run)
8) Tap “View it”
   - routes to correct screen (Calendar/Plan/Journal etc)

--------------------------------------------
6) Output required from Agent
--------------------------------------------
- Exact files changed list
- Where spotlight reads guest-storage
- Where dismiss flag is saved
- What route “View it” navigates to for each focusArea
